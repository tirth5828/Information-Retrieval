mr

is
my
ancient
and
intim
friend
there
is
likewis
some
relat
between
us
on
the
mother’
side
about
three
year
ago
mr
gulliv
grow
weari
of
the
concours
of
curiou
peopl
come
to
him
at
hi
hous
in
redriff
made
a
small
purchas
of

with
a
conveni
hous
near
newark
in
nottinghamshir
hi
nativ
countri
where
he
now
live
retir
yet
in
good
esteem
among
hi
neighbour
although
mr
gulliv
wa
born
in
nottinghamshir
where
hi
father
dwelt
yet
i
have
heard
him
say
hi
famili
came
from
oxfordshir
to
confirm
which
i
have
observ
in
the
churchyard
at
banburi
in
that
counti
sever
tomb
and
monument
of
the
gulliv
befor
he
quit
redriff
he
left

follow
paper
in

with
the
liberti
to
dispos
of
them
as
i
should
think
fit
i
have
care
perus
them
three
time
the
style
is
veri
plain
and
simpl
and
the
onli
fault
i
find
is
that
the
author
after
the
manner
of
travel
is
a
littl
too
circumstanti
there
is
an
air
of
truth
appar
through
the
whole
and
inde
the
author
wa
so
distinguish
for
hi
verac
that
it
becam
a
sort
of
proverb
among
hi
neighbour
at
redriff
when
ani
one
affirm
a
thing
to
say
it
wa
as
true
as
if
mr
gulliv
had
spoken
it
by
the
advic
of
sever
worthi
person
to
whom
with
the
author’
permiss
i
commun
these
paper
i
now
ventur
to
send
them
into
the
world
hope
they
may
be
at
least
for
some
time
a
better
entertain
to
our
young
noblemen
than
the
common
scribbl
of
polit
and
parti
thi
volum
would
have
been
at
least
twice
as
larg
if
i
had
not
made
bold
to
strike
out
innumer
passag
relat
to
the
wind
and
tide
as
well
as
to
the
variat
and
bear
in
the
sever
voyag
togeth
with
the
minut
descript
of
the
manag
of
the
ship
in
storm
in
the
style
of
sailor
likewis
the
account
of
longitud
and
latitud
wherein
i
have
reason
to
apprehend
that
mr
gulliv
may
be
a
littl
dissatisfi
but
i
wa
resolv
to
fit
the
work
as
much
as
possibl
to
the
gener
capac
of

howev
if
my

ignor
in

shall
have
led

and
if

hath
a
curios
to
see
the
whole
work
at
larg
as
it
came
from
the
hand
of

i
hope
you

be
readi

you
shall
be
call
to
it
that
by
your
great

prevail
on
me
to
publish
a
veri
loos

uncorrect
account
of
my
travel
with
direct
to
hire
some
young
gentleman
of
either
univers
to
put
them
in
order
and
correct
the
style
as
my
cousin
dampier
did
by
my
advic
in
hi
book
call
“a
voyag
round
the
world.”
but
i
do
not
rememb
i
gave
you
power
to
consent
that
ani
thing
should
be
omit
and
much
less
that
ani

should
be
insert
therefor
as
to
the
latter
i
do
here
renounc
everi

of

kind
particularli
a
paragraph
about
her
majesti
queen
ann
of
most
piou
and
gloriou
memori
although
i
did
rever
and
esteem
her
more
than
ani
of

speci
but
you
or
your
interpol
ought
to
have
consid
that
it
wa
not

wa
it
not

to

the
first
whereof
wa
the

so
that
you

apt

to
interpret

to
punish
everi

which
look
like
an

as
i

how
could

have
not

the
most

yet
i
cannot

but
shall
leav
that
matter
to
my
judici
and
candid
reader
to
adjust
it
as
they
pleas
i
hear
some
of
our
sea
yahoo
find
fault
with
my
sea-languag
as
not
proper
in
mani
part
nor
now
in
use
i
cannot
help
it
in
my
first
voyag
while
i
wa
young
i
wa
instruct
by
the
oldest
marin
and
learn
to
speak
as
they
did
but
i
have
sinc
found
that
the
sea
yahoo
are
apt
like
the
land
one
to
becom
new-fangl
in
their
word
which
the
latter
chang
everi
year
insomuch
as
i
rememb
upon
each
return
to
my
own
countri
their
old
dialect
wa
so
alter
that
i
could
hardli
understand
the
new
and
i
observ
when
ani
yahoo
come
from
london
out
of
curios
to
visit
me
at
my
hous
we
neither
of
us
are
abl
to
deliv
our
concept
in
a
manner
intellig
to
the
other
if
the
censur
of
the
yahoo
could
ani
way
affect
me
i
should
have
great
reason
to
complain
that
some
of
them
are
so
bold
as
to
think
my
book
of
travel
a
mere
fiction
out
of
mine
own
brain
and
have
gone
so
far
as
to
drop
hint
that
the
houyhnhnm
and
yahoo
have
no
more
exist
than
the
inhabit
of
utopia
inde
i
must
confess
that
as
to
the
peopl
of
lilliput
brobdingrag
for
so
the
word
should
have
been
spelt
and
not
erron
brobdingnag
and
laputa
i
have
never
yet
heard
of
ani
yahoo
so
presumptu
as
to
disput
their
be
or
the
fact
i
have
relat
concern
them
becaus
the
truth
immedi
strike
everi
reader
with
convict
and
is
there
less
probabl
in
my
account
of
the
houyhnhnm
or
yahoo
when
it
is
manifest
as
to
the
latter
there
are
so
mani
thousand
even
in
thi
countri
who
onli
differ
from
their
brother
brute
in
houyhnhnmland
becaus
they
use
a
sort
of
jabber
and
do
not
go
naked?
i
wrote
for
their
amend
and
not
their
approb
the
unit
prais
of
the
whole
race
would
be
of
less
consequ
to
me
than
the
neigh
of
those
two
degener
houyhnhnm
i
keep
in
my
stabl
becaus
from
these
degener
as
they
are
i
still
improv
in
some
virtu
without
ani
mixtur
of
vice
do
these
miser
anim
presum
to
think
that
i
am
so
degener
as
to
defend
my
veracity?
yahoo
as
i
am
it
is
well
known
through
all
houyhnhnmland
that
by
the
instruct
and
exampl
of
my
illustri
master
i
wa
abl
in
the
compass
of
two
year
although
i
confess
with
the
utmost
difficulti
to
remov
that
infern
habit
of
lie
shuffl
deceiv
and
equivoc
so
deepli
root
in
the
veri
soul
of
all
my
speci
especi
the
european
i
have
other
complaint
to
make
upon
thi
vexati
occas
but
i
forbear
troubl
myself
or
you
ani
further
i
must
freeli
confess
that
sinc
my
last

some
corrupt
of

reviv
in

by
convers
with
a
few
of

particularli
those
of

should
never

so
absurd
a
project
as
that
of

of

that
in

from

indi
we
were
driven
by
a
violent
storm
to
the
north-west
of
van

by
an
observ
we
found
ourselv
in
the
latitud
of
30
degre
2
minut
south
twelv
of
our
crew
were
dead
by
immoder
labour
and
ill

the
rest
were
in
a

weak
condit
on
the
5th
of
novemb
which
wa
the
begin
of
summer
in

hazi
the
seamen
spi
a
rock
within
half
a
cable’
length
of
the
ship
but
the
wind
wa
so
strong
that
we
were
driven
directli
upon
it
and
immedi
split
six
of
the
crew
of
whom
i
wa
one
have
let
down
the
boat
into
the
sea
made
a
shift
to
get
clear
of
the
ship
and
the
rock
we
row
by
my
comput
about
three
leagu
till
we
were
abl
to
work
no

be
alreadi
spent
with
labour
while
we
were
in
the
ship
we
therefor
trust
ourselv
to
the
merci
of
the
wave
and
in
about
half
an
hour
the
boat
wa
overset
by
a
sudden
flurri
from
the
north
what
becam
of
my
companion
in
the
boat
as
well
as
of
those
who
escap
on
the
rock
or
were
left
in
the
vessel
i
cannot
tell
but
conclud
they
were
all
lost
for
my
own
part
i
swam
as
fortun
direct
me
and
wa
push
forward
by
wind
and
tide
i
often
let
my
leg
drop
and
could
feel
no
bottom
but
when
i
wa
almost
gone
and
abl
to
struggl
no
longer
i
found
myself
within
my
depth
and
by
thi
time
the
storm
wa
much
abat
the
decliv
wa
so
small
that
i
walk
near
a
mile
befor
i
got
to
the
shore
which
i
conjectur
wa
about
eight
o’clock
in
the
even
i
then
advanc
forward
near
half
a
mile
but
could
not
discov
ani
sign
of
hous
or
inhabit
at
least
i
wa
in
so
weak
a
condit
that
i
did
not
observ
them
i
wa
extrem
tire
and
with
that
and
the
heat
of
the
weather
and
about
half
a
pint
of
brandi
that
i
drank
as
i
left
the
ship
i
found
myself
much
inclin
to
sleep
i
lay
down
on
the
grass
which
wa
veri
short
and
soft
where
i
slept
sounder
than
ever
i
rememb
to
have
done
in
my
life
and
as
i
reckon
about
nine
hour
for
when
i
awak
it
wa
just
day-light
i
attempt
to
rise
but
wa
not
abl
to
stir
for
as
i
happen
to
lie
on
my
back
i
found
my
arm
and
leg
were
strongli
fasten
on
each
side
to
the
ground
and
my
hair
which
wa
long
and
thick
tie
down
in
the
same
manner
i
likewis
felt
sever
slender
ligatur
across
my
bodi
from
my
arm-pit
to
my
thigh
i
could
onli
look
upward
the
sun
began
to
grow
hot
and
the
light
offend
my
eye
i
heard
a
confus
nois
about
me
but
in
the
postur
i
lay
could
see
noth
except
the
sky
in
a
littl
time
i
felt
someth
aliv
move
on
my
left
leg
which
advanc
gentli
forward
over
my
breast
came
almost
up
to
my
chin
when
bend
my
eye
downward
as
much
as
i
could
i
perceiv
it
to
be
a
human
creatur
not
six
inch
high
with
a
bow
and
arrow
in
hi
hand
and
a
quiver
at
hi
back
in
the
mean
time
i
felt
at
least
forti
more
of
the
same
kind
as
i
conjectur
follow
the
first
i
wa
in
the
utmost
astonish
and
roar
so
loud
that
they
all
ran
back
in
a
fright
and
some
of
them
as
i
wa
afterward
told
were
hurt
with
the
fall
they
got
by
leap
from
my
side
upon
the
ground
howev
they
soon
return
and
one
of
them
who
ventur
so
far
as
to
get
a
full
sight
of
my
face
lift
up
hi
hand
and
eye
by
way
of
admir
cri
out
in
a
shrill
but
distinct
voic
hekinah
degul
the
other
repeat
the
same
word
sever
time
but
then
i
knew
not
what
they
meant
i
lay
all
thi
while
as
the
reader
may
believ
in
great
uneasi
at
length
struggl
to
get
loos
i
had
the
fortun
to
break
the
string
and
wrench
out
the
peg
that
fasten
my
left
arm
to
the
ground
for
by
lift
it
up
to
my
face
i
discov
the
method
they
had
taken
to
bind
me
and
at
the
same
time
with
a
violent
pull
which
gave
me
excess
pain
i
a
littl
loosen
the
string
that
tie
down
my
hair
on
the
left
side
so
that
i
wa
just
abl
to
turn
my
head
about
two
inch
but
the
creatur
ran
off
a
second
time
befor
i
could
seiz
them
whereupon
there
wa
a
great
shout
in
a
veri
shrill
accent
and
after
it
ceas
i
heard
one
of
them
cri
aloud
tolgo
phonac
when
in
an
instant
i
felt
abov
a
hundr
arrow
discharg
on
my
left
hand
which
prick
me
like
so
mani
needl
and
besid
they
shot
anoth
flight
into
the
air
as
we
do
bomb
in
europ
whereof
mani
i
suppos
fell
on
my
bodi
though
i
felt
them
not
and
some
on
my
face
which
i
immedi
cover
with
my
left
hand
when
thi
shower
of
arrow
wa
over
i
fell
a
groan
with
grief
and
pain
and
then
strive
again
to
get
loos
they
discharg
anoth
volley
larger
than
the
first
and
some
of
them
attempt
with
spear
to
stick
me
in
the
side
but
by
good
luck
i
had
on
a
buff
jerkin
which
they
could
not
pierc
i
thought
it
the
most
prudent
method
to
lie
still
and
my
design
wa
to
continu
so
till
night
when
my
left
hand
be
alreadi
loos
i
could
easili
free
myself
and
as
for
the
inhabit
i
had
reason
to
believ
i
might
be
a
match
for
the
greatest
armi
they
could
bring
against
me
if
they
were
all
of
the
same
size
with
him
that
i
saw
but
fortun
dispos
otherwis
of
me
when
the
peopl
observ
i
wa
quiet
they
discharg
no
more
arrow
but
by
the
nois
i
heard
i
knew
their
number
increas
and
about
four
yard
from
me
over
against
my
right
ear
i
heard
a
knock
for
abov
an
hour
like
that
of
peopl
at
work
when
turn
my
head
that
way
as
well
as
the
peg
and
string
would
permit
me
i
saw
a
stage
erect
about
a
foot
and
a
half
from
the
ground
capabl
of
hold
four
of
the
inhabit
with
two
or
three
ladder
to
mount
it
from
whenc
one
of
them
who
seem
to
be
a
person
of
qualiti
made
me
a
long
speech
whereof
i
understood
not
one
syllabl
but
i
should
have
mention
that
befor
the
princip
person
began
hi
orat
he
cri
out
three
time
langro
dehul
san
these
word
and
the
former
were
afterward
repeat
and
explain
to
me
whereupon
immedi
about
fifti
of
the
inhabit
came
and
cut
the
string
that
fasten
the
left
side
of
my
head
which
gave
me
the
liberti
of
turn
it
to
the
right
and
of
observ
the
person
and
gestur
of
him
that
wa
to
speak
he
appear
to
be
of
a
middl
age
and
taller
than
ani
of
the
other
three
who
attend
him
whereof
one
wa
a
page
that
held
up
hi
train
and
seem
to
be
somewhat
longer
than
my
middl
finger
the
other
two
stood
one
on
each
side
to
support
him
he
act
everi
part
of
an
orat
and
i
could
observ
mani
period
of
threaten
and
other
of
promis
piti
and
kind
i
answer
in
a
few
word
but
in
the
most
submiss
manner
lift
up
my
left
hand
and
both
my
eye
to
the
sun
as
call
him
for
a
wit
and
be
almost
famish
with
hunger
have
not
eaten
a
morsel
for
some
hour
befor
i
left
the
ship
i
found
the
demand
of
natur
so
strong
upon
me
that
i
could
not
forbear
show
my
impati
perhap
against
the
strict
rule
of
decenc
by
put
my
finger
frequent
to
my
mouth
to
signifi
that
i
want
food
the
hurgo
for
so
they
call
a
great
lord
as
i
afterward
learnt
understood
me
veri
well
he
descend
from
the
stage
and
command
that
sever
ladder
should
be
appli
to
my
side
on
which
abov
a
hundr
of
the
inhabit
mount
and
walk
toward
my
mouth
laden
with
basket
full
of
meat
which
had
been
provid
and
sent
thither
by
the
king’
order
upon
the
first
intellig
he
receiv
of
me
i
observ
there
wa
the
flesh
of
sever
anim
but
could
not
distinguish
them
by
the
tast
there
were
shoulder
leg
and
loin
shape
like
those
of
mutton
and
veri
well
dress
but
smaller
than
the
wing
of
a
lark
i
ate
them
by
two
or
three
at
a
mouth
and
took
three
loav
at
a
time
about
the
big
of
musket
bullet
they
suppli
me
as
fast
as
they
could
show
a
thousand
mark
of
wonder
and
astonish
at
my
bulk
and
appetit
i
then
made
anoth
sign
that
i
want
drink
they
found
by
my
eat
that
a
small
quantiti
would
not
suffic
me
and
be
a
most
ingeni
peopl
they
slung
up
with
great
dexter
one
of
their
largest
hogshead
then
roll
it
toward
my
hand
and
beat
out
the
top
i
drank
it
off
at
a
draught
which
i
might
well
do
for
it
did
not
hold
half
a
pint
and
tast
like
a
small
wine
of
burgundi
but
much
more
delici
they
brought
me
a
second
hogshead
which
i
drank
in
the
same
manner
and
made
sign
for
more
but
they
had
none
to
give
me
when
i
had
perform
these
wonder
they
shout
for
joy
and
danc
upon
my
breast
repeat
sever
time
as
they
did
at
first
hekinah
degul
they
made
me
a
sign
that
i
should
throw
down
the
two
hogshead
but
first
warn
the
peopl
below
to
stand
out
of
the
way
cri
aloud
borach
mevolah
and
when
they
saw
the
vessel
in
the
air
there
wa
a
univers
shout
of
hekinah
degul
i
confess
i
wa
often
tempt
while
they
were
pass
backward
and
forward
on
my
bodi
to
seiz
forti
or
fifti
of
the
first
that
came
in
my
reach
and
dash
them
against
the
ground
but
the
remembr
of
what
i
had
felt
which
probabl
might
not
be
the
worst
they
could
do
and
the
promis
of
honour
i
made
them—for
so
i
interpret
my
submiss
behaviour—soon
drove
out
these
imagin
besid
i
now
consid
myself
as
bound
by
the
law
of
hospit
to
a
peopl
who
had
treat
me
with
so
much
expens
and
magnific
howev
in
my
thought
i
could
not
suffici
wonder
at
the
intrepid
of
these
diminut
mortal
who
durst
ventur
to
mount
and
walk
upon
my
bodi
while
one
of
my
hand
wa
at
liberti
without
trembl
at
the
veri
sight
of
so
prodigi
a
creatur
as
i
must
appear
to
them
after
some
time
when
they
observ
that
i
made
no
more
demand
for
meat
there
appear
befor
me
a
person
of
high
rank
from
hi
imperi
majesti
hi
excel
have
mount
on
the
small
of
my
right
leg
advanc
forward
up
to
my

with
about
a
dozen
of
hi
retinu
and
produc
hi
credenti
under
the
signet
royal
which
he
appli
close
to
my
eye
spoke
about
ten
minut
without
ani
sign
of
anger
but
with
a
kind
of
determin
resolut
often
point
forward
which
as
i
afterward
found
wa
toward
the
capit
citi
about
half
a
mile
distant
whither
it
wa
agre
by
hi
majesti
in
council
that
i
must
be
convey
i
answer
in
few
word
but
to
no
purpos
and
made
a
sign
with
my
hand
that
wa
loos
put
it
to
the
other
but
over
hi
excellency’
head
for
fear
of
hurt
him
or
hi
train
and
then
to
my
own
head
and
bodi
to
signifi
that
i
desir
my
liberti
it
appear
that
he
understood
me
well
enough
for
he
shook
hi
head
by
way
of
disapprob
and
held
hi
hand
in
a
postur
to
show
that
i
must
be
carri
as
a
prison
howev
he
made
other
sign
to
let
me
understand
that
i
should
have
meat
and
drink
enough
and
veri
good
treatment
whereupon
i
onc
more
thought
of
attempt
to
break
my
bond
but
again
when
i
felt
the
smart
of
their
arrow
upon
my
face
and
hand
which
were
all
in
blister
and
mani
of
the
dart
still
stick
in
them
and
observ
likewis
that
the
number
of
my
enemi
increas
i
gave
token
to
let
them
know
that
they
might
do
with
me
what
they
pleas
upon
thi
the
hurgo
and
hi
train
withdrew
with
much
civil
and
cheer
counten
soon
after
i
heard
a
gener
shout
with
frequent
repetit
of
the
word
peplom
selan
and
i
felt
great
number
of
peopl
on
my
left
side
relax
the
cord
to
such
a
degre
that
i
wa
abl
to
turn
upon
my
right
and
to
eas
myself
with
make
water
which
i
veri
plenti
did
to
the
great
astonish
of
the
peopl
who
conjectur
by
my
motion
what
i
wa
go
to
do
immedi
open
to
the
right
and
left
on
that
side
to
avoid
the
torrent
which
fell
with
such
nois
and
violenc
from
me
but
befor
thi
they
had
daub
my
face
and
both
my
hand
with
a
sort
of
ointment
veri
pleasant
to
the
smell
which
in
a
few
minut
remov
all
the

i
had
receiv

were

i
slept
about
eight
hour
as
i
wa

it
wa
no

for
the
physician
by
the
emperor’
order
had
mingl
a

potion
in

of

it
seem
that
upon

after

the

which
i
everi

repeat
on

hi
answer
as

“that

i
said
“hi
majesti
should
be
satisfi
for
i
wa
readi
to
strip
myself
and
turn
up
my
pocket
befor
him.”
thi
i
deliv
part
in
word
and
part
in
sign
he
repli
“that

he
had
so
good
an

i
took
up

then
into

i
interpret

“after

as
to

that
for

that

we
comput
the

the
power
is
wholli
on

we
apprehend
hi

made

a

to

in

and
desir

some

the

i

me
as
i
could
perceiv
in

cold
manner
but
could
not
guess
the

till
i
had
a
whisper
from
a
certain
person
“that
flimnap

bolgolam
had
repres
my

ambassador
as
a

of

from
which
i
am
sure
my
heart
wa
wholli
free
and
thi
wa
the
first
time
i
began
to
conceiv
some
imperfect
idea
of

is
to
be
observ
that
these
ambassador
spoke
to
me
by
an

the
languag
of
both

upon

yet
our

he
had
got
by
the
seizur
of
their

oblig
them
to
deliv
their

and
make
their
speech
in
the
lilliputian
tongu
and
it
must
be
confess
that
from
the
great
intercours
of
trade
and
commerc
between
both
realm
from
the
continu
recept
of
exil
which
is
mutual
among
them
and
from
the
custom
in

to
send
their

as

i
have
some

gave

an

observ
about
half
a

somewhat
that
look
like
a

overturn
i
pull
off
my

two

three
hundr
yard
i
found
the
object
to
approach
nearer
by
forc
of
the

and
then
plainli
saw
it
to
be
a
real
boat
which
i
suppos
might
by
some
tempest
have
been
driven
from
a

whereupon
i
return

first
discov
the

i
found
the

had
driven
it
still
nearer
the
seamen
were
all
provid
with
cordag
which
i
had
beforehand
twist
to
a
suffici
strength
when
the
ship
came
up
i
strip
myself
and
wade
till
i
came
within
a
hundr
yard
of
the
boat
after
which
i
wa
forc
to
swim
till
i
got
up
to
it
the
seamen
threw
me
the
end
of
the
cord
which
i
fasten
to
a
hole
in
the
fore-part
of
the
boat
and
the
other
end
to
a
man
of

but
i
found
all
my
labour
to
littl
purpos
for
be
out
of
my
depth
i
wa
not
abl
to
work
in
thi
necess

wa
forc
to
swim
behind
and
push
the

forward
as
often
as
i
could
with
one
of
my
hand
and
the

favour
me
i
advanc
so
far
that
i
could
just
hold
up
my

and
feel
the
ground
i
rest
two

then
gave
the

anoth
shove
and
so
on
till
the

wa
no

and
now
the
most

i
took
out

which
were
stow
in

i
got
dri
to

by

men
with

where
a
mighti
concours
of

full
of

at

which
after

not

from

notic
of

believ
i

which
wa
well

in

at

thi

had
instruct
to

“the

leniti
of

no
farther

hour
i
should

the
envoy
further
ad
“that
in

to
maintain
the

and
amiti
between

expect
that

would
give
order
to
have
me
sent

the
emperor
of
blefuscu
have
taken
three
day
to
consult
return
an
answer
consist
of
mani
civil
and
excus
he
said
“that

that

i
had
found
a

he
hope
in

about

as
our

at

it
wa
a
perfect

us
all
prepar

which
accordingli

call
the

began

find
it
wa
like
to
overblow
we
took
in
our
sprit-sail
and
stood
by

hand
the
fore-sail
but
make
foul
weather
we
look
the
gun
were
all
fast
and
hand
the
mizen
the
ship
lay
veri
broad
off
so
we
thought
it
better
spoon
befor
the
sea
than
tri
or
hull
we
reef
the
fore-sail
and
set
him
and
haul
aft
the
fore-sheet
the
helm
wa
hard
a-weath
the
ship
wore
brave
we
belay
the
fore
down-haul
but
the
sail
wa
split
and
we
haul
down
the
yard
and
got
the

into
the
ship
and
unbound
all
the
thing
clear
of
it
it
wa
a

fierc
storm
the

broke
strang
and
danger
we
haul
off
upon
the
laniard
of
the
whip-staff
and
help
the
man
at
the
helm
we
would
not
get
down
our
topmast
but
let
all
stand
becaus
she
scud
befor
the
sea
veri
well
and
we
knew
that
the
top-mast
be
aloft
the
ship
wa
the
wholesom
and
made
better
way
through
the
sea
see
we
had
sea-room
when
the
storm
wa
over
we
set
fore-sail
and
main-sail
and
brought
the

we
set
the

kept

wa
follow
by

west-south-west
we
were
carri
by
my

about
five
hundr

so
that
the

could
not
tell

we
were

held
out
well
our
ship
wa
staunch
and
our
crew
all
in
good
health
but
we
lay
in
the
utmost
distress
for
water
we
thought
it
best
to
hold
on
the

cours
rather
than
turn
more
northerli
which
might
have
brought
us
to
the
north-west
part

day
of

a

discov
land
on
the
17th
we
came
in
full
view
of
a
great
island
or

we
knew
not
whether
on
the
south

whereof
wa
a

jut
out
into

and
a

too
shallow
to
hold
a
ship
of

one
hundr
ton
we
cast
anchor
within
a
leagu
of
thi
creek
and
our

sent
a
dozen
of
hi
men
well
arm
in
the
long-boat
with
vessel
for
water
if
ani
could
be
found
i
desir

to
go
with
them
that
i
might
see
the
countri
and
make
what
discoveri
i
could
when
we
came
to
land
we
saw
no
river
or
spring
nor
ani
sign
of

our
men
therefor
wander
on
the
shore
to
find
out
some
fresh
water
near
the
sea
and
i
walk
alon
about
a
mile
on
the
other
side
where
i
observ
the
countri
all
barren
and
rocki
i
now
began
to
be
weari
and
see
noth
to
entertain
my
curios
i
return
gentli
down
toward
the
creek
and
the
sea
be
full
in
my
view
i
saw
our
men
alreadi
got
into
the
boat
and
row
for
life
to
the
ship
i
wa
go
to
holla
after
them
although
it
had
been
to
littl
purpos
when
i
observ
a
huge
creatur
walk
after
them
in
the
sea
as
fast
as
he
could
he
wade
not
much
deeper
than
hi
knee
and
took
prodigi
stride
but
our
men
had
the
start
of
him
half
a
leagu
and
the
sea
thereabout
be
full
of
sharp-point
rock
the
monster
wa
not
abl
to
overtak
the
boat
thi
i
wa
afterward
told
for
i
durst
not
stay
to
see
the
issu
of
the
adventur
but
ran
as
fast
as
i
could
the
way
i
first
went
and
then
climb
up
a
steep
hill
which
gave
me
some
prospect
of
the
countri
i
found
it
fulli
cultiv
but
that
which
first
surpris
me
wa
the
length
of
the
grass
which
in
those
ground
that
seem
to
be
kept
for
hay
wa
about
twenti
feet
high
i
fell
into
a
high
road
for
so
i
took
it
to
be
though
it
serv
to
the
inhabit
onli
as
a
foot-path
through
a
field
of
barley
here
i
walk
on
for
some
time
but
could
see
littl
on
either
side
it
be
now
near
harvest
and
the
corn
rise
at
least
forti
feet
i
wa
an
hour
walk
to
the
end
of
thi
field
which
wa
fenc
in
with
a
hedg
of
at

one
hundr
and
twenti
feet
high
and
the
tree
so
lofti
that
i
could
make
no
comput
of
their
altitud
there
wa
a
stile
to
pass
from
thi
field
into
the
next
it
had
four
step
and
a
stone
to
cross
over
when
you
came
to
the
uppermost
it
wa
imposs
for
me
to
climb
thi
stile
becaus
everi
step
wa
six-feet
high
and
the
upper
stone
about
twenti
i
wa
endeavour
to
find
some
gap
in
the
hedg
when
i
discov
one
of
the
inhabit
in
the
next
field
advanc
toward
the
stile
of
the
same
size
with
him
whom
i
saw
in
the
sea
pursu
our
boat
he
appear
as
tall
as
an
ordinari
spire
steepl
and
took
about
ten
yard
at
everi
stride
as
near
as
i
could
guess
i
wa
struck
with
the
utmost
fear
and
astonish
and
ran
to
hide
myself
in
the
corn
whenc
i
saw
him
at
the
top
of
the
stile
look
back
into
the
next
field
on
the
right
hand
and
heard
him
call
in
a
voic
mani
degre
louder
than
a
speaking-trumpet
but
the
nois
wa
so
high
in
the
air
that
at
first
i
certainli
thought
it
wa
thunder
whereupon
seven
monster
like
himself
came
toward
him
with
reaping-hook
in
their
hand
each
hook
about
the
larg
of
six
scyth
these

were
not
so
well
clad
as
the
first
whose
servant
or
labour
they
seem
to
be
for
upon
some
word
he
spoke
they
went
to
reap
the
corn
in
the
field
where
i
lay
i
kept
from
them
at
as
great
a
distanc
as
i
could
but
wa
forc
to

with
extrem
difficulti
for
the

so
that
i
could
hardli
squeez
my
bodi
betwixt

howev
i
made
a
shift
to
go
forward
till
i
came
to
a
part
of
the
field
where
the
corn
had
been
laid
by
the
rain
and
wind
here
it
wa
imposs

so
strong
and
point
that
they
pierc
through
my

into

at
the

time
i
heard
the
reaper
not

yard
behind
me
be
quit
dispirit
with
toil
and
wholli
overcom
by
grief
and
dispair
i
lay
down
between

might
there
end
my

i
bemoan
my

i
lament
my

a

voyag
against
the

all
my

relat
in
thi
terribl
agit
of

i
could
not
forbear
think
of
lilliput
whose
inhabit
look
upon
me
as
the
greatest
prodigi
that
ever
appear
in
the
world
where
i
wa
abl
to
draw
an
imperi
fleet
in
my

and
perform
those
other
action
which
will
be
record
for
ever
in
the
chronicl
of
that
empir
while
poster
shall
hardli
believ
them
although
attest
by
million
i
reflect
what
a
mortif
it
must
prove
to
me
to
appear
as
inconsider
in
thi
nation
as
one
singl
lilliputian
would
be
among
us
but
thi
i
conceiv
wa
to
be
the
least
of
my
misfortun
for
as
human
creatur
are
observ
to
be
more
savag
and
cruel
in
proport
to
their
bulk
what
could
i
expect
but
to
be
a
morsel
in
the
mouth
of
the
first
among
these
enorm
barbarian
that
should
happen
to
seiz
me?
undoubtedli
philosoph
are
in
the
right
when
they
tell
us
that
noth
is
great
or
littl
otherwis
than
by
comparison
it
might
have
pleas
fortun
to
have
let
the
lilliputian
find
some
nation
where
the
peopl
were
as
diminut
with
respect
to
them
as
they
were
to
me
and
who
know
but
that
even
thi
prodigi
race
of
mortal
might
be
equal
overmatch
in
some
distant
part
of
the
world
whereof
we
have
yet
no
discoveri
scare
and
confound
as
i
wa
i
could
not
forbear
go
on
with
these
reflect
when
one
of
the
reaper
approach
within
ten
yard
of
the
ridg
where
i
lay
made
me
apprehend
that
with
the
next
step
i
should
be
squash
to
death
under
hi
foot
or
cut
in
two
with
hi
reaping-hook
and
therefor
when
he
wa
again
about
to
move
i
scream
as
loud
as
fear
could
make
me
whereupon
the
huge
creatur
trod
short
and
look
round
about
under
him
for
some
time
at
last
espi
me
as
i
lay
on
the
ground
he
consid
awhil
with
the
caution
of
one
who
endeavour
to
lay
hold
on
a
small
danger
anim
in
such
a
manner
that
it
shall
not
be
abl
either
to
scratch
or
bite
him
as
i
myself
have
sometim
done
with
a
weasel
in
england
at
length
he
ventur
to
take
me
behind
by
the
middl
between
hi
fore-fing
and
thumb
and
brought
me
within
three
yard
of
hi
eye
that
he
might
behold
my
shape
more
perfectli
i
guess
hi
mean
and
my
good
fortun
gave
me
so
much
presenc
of
mind
that
i
resolv
not
to
struggl
in
the
least
as
he
held
me
in
the
air
abov
sixti
feet
from
the

although
he
grievous
pinch
my

for
fear
i
should
slip
through
hi

all
i
ventur
wa
to
rais
my

toward

and
place
my

togeth
in

postur
and
to
speak
some
word
in
a
humbl
melancholi
tone
suitabl
to
the
condit
i
then
wa
in
for
i
apprehend
everi

that
he
would
dash
me
against
the
ground
as
we
usual
do
ani
littl
hate
anim
which
we
have
a
mind
to
destroy
but
my
good
star
would
have
it
that
he
appear
pleas
with
my
voic
and
gestur
and
began
to
look
upon
me
as
a
curios
much
wonder
to
hear
me
pronounc
articul
word
although
he
could
not
understand
them
in
the

i
wa
not
abl
to
forbear
groan
and
shed
tear
and
turn
my
head
toward
my
side
let
him
know
as
well
as
i
could
how
cruelli
i
wa
hurt
by
the
pressur
of
hi
thumb
and
finger
he
seem
to
apprehend
my
mean
for
lift
up
the
lappet
of
hi
coat
he
put
me
gentli
into
it
and
immedi
ran
along
with
me
to
hi
master
who
wa
a
substanti
farmer
and
the

person
i
had
first
seen
in

receiv
such
an

of
me
as
hi

could
give
him
took
a
piec
of
a
small
straw
about
the
size
of
a
walking-staff
and
therewith
lift
up
the
lappet
of
my
coat
which
it
seem
he
thought
to
be
some
kind
of
cover
that
natur
had
given
me
he
blew
my
hair
asid
to
take
a
better
view
of
my
face
he
call
hi
hind
about
him
and
ask
them
as
i
afterward
learn
whether
they
had
ever
seen
in
the
field
ani
littl
creatur
that
resembl
me
he
then
place
me
softli
on
the
ground
upon
all
four
but
i
got
immedi
up
and
walk
slowli
backward
and
forward
to
let
those
peopl
see
i
had
no
intent
to
run
away
they
all
sat
down
in
a
circl
about
me
the
better
to
observ
my
motion
i
pull
off
my
hat
and
made
a
low
bow
toward
the
farmer
i
fell
on
my
knee
and
lift
up
my
hand
and
eye
and
spoke
sever
word
as
loud
as
i
could
i
took
a
purs
of
gold
out
of
my

and
humbl
present
it
to
him
he
receiv
it
on
the
palm
of
hi
hand
then
appli
it
close
to
hi
eye
to
see
what
it
wa
and
afterward
turn
it
sever
time
with
the
point
of
a
pin
which
he
took
out
of
hi
sleev
but
could
make
noth
of
it
whereupon
i
made
a
sign
that
he
should
place
hi
hand
on
the
ground
i
then
took
the
purs
and
open
it
pour
all
the
gold
into
hi
palm
there
were
six
spanish

after
offer

to
him
sever
time
i
thought
it
best
to
do
the
farmer
by
thi
time
wa
convinc
i
must
be
a
ration
creatur
he
spoke
often
to
me
but
the
sound
of

as
i
could
easili
do

to
obey
and
for
fear
of

at

length
upon

made
three

but
advanc
forward
toward
my
master
as
i
shall
henceforth
call
him
hi
youngest
son
who
sat
next
to

an
arch
boy
of
about
ten
year
old
took

up
by

held

so
high
in

order

to
be
taken
from

but
be
afraid

well
rememb
how
mischiev

i
fell

to
understand
as
well
as
i
could
that
i
desir

the

which
my

made
him
stroke
me
gentli
with

in
the
midst
of
dinner
my

favourit
cat
leap
into
her
lap
i
heard
a
nois
behind
me
like
that
of
a
dozen
stocking-weav
at
work
and
turn
my
head
i
found
it
proceed
from
the
pur
of
that
anim
who
seem
to
be
three
time
larger
than
an
ox
as
i
comput
by
the
view
of
her
head
and
one
of
her
paw
while
her
mistress
wa
feed
and
stroke
her
the
fierc
of
thi
creature’
counten
altogeth
discompos
me
though
i
stood
at
the
farther
end
of
the
tabl
abov
fifti
feet
off
and
although
my
mistress
held
her
fast
for
fear
she
might
give
a
spring
and
seiz
me
in
her
talon
but
it
happen
there
wa
no
danger
for
the
cat
took
not
the
least
notic
of
me
when
my
master
place
me
within
three
yard
of
her
and
as
i
have
been
alway
told
and
found
true
by
experi
in
my
travel
that
fli
or
discov
fear
befor
a
fierc
anim
is
a
certain
way
to
make
it
pursu
or
attack
you
so
i
resolv
in
thi
danger
junctur
to
show
no
manner
of
concern
i
walk
with
intrepid
five
or
six
time
befor
the
veri
head
of
the
cat
and
came
within
half
a
yard
of
her
whereupon
she
drew
herself
back
as
if
she
were
more
afraid
of
me
i
had
less
apprehens
concern
the
dog
whereof
three
or
four
came
into
the
room
as
it
is
usual
in
farmers’
hous
one
of
which
wa
a
mastiff
equal
in
bulk
to
four
eleph
and
anoth
a
greyhound
somewhat
taller
than
the
mastiff
but
not
so
larg
when
dinner
wa
almost
done
the
nurs
came
in
with
a
child
of
a
year
old
in
her
arm
who
immedi
spi
me
and
began
a
squall
that
you
might
have
heard
from
london
bridg
to
chelsea
after
the
usual
oratori
of
infant
to
get
me
for
a
playth
the
mother
out
of
pure
indulg
took
me
up
and
put
me
toward
the
child
who
present
seiz
me
by
the
middl
and
got
my
head
into
hi
mouth
where
i
roar
so
loud
that
the
urchin
wa
fright
and
let
me
drop
and
i
should
infal
have
broke
my
neck
if
the
mother
had
not
held
her
apron
under
me
the
nurs
to
quiet
her
babe
made
use
of
a
rattl
which
wa
a
kind
of
hollow
vessel
fill
with
great
stone
and
fasten
by
a
cabl
to
the
child’
waist
but
all
in
vain
so
that
she
wa
forc
to
appli
the
last
remedi
by
give
it
suck
i
must
confess
no
object
ever
disgust
me
so
much
as
the
sight
of
her
monstrou
breast
which
i
cannot
tell
what
to
compar
with
so
as
to
give
the
curiou
reader
an
idea
of
it
bulk
shape
and
colour
it
stood
promin
six
feet
and
could
not
be
less
than
sixteen
in
circumfer
the
nippl
wa
about
half
the
big
of
my
head
and
the
hue
both
of
that
and
the
dug
so
vari
with
spot
pimpl
and
freckl
that
noth
could
appear
more
nauseou
for
i
had
a
near
sight
of
her
she
sit
down
the
more
conveni
to
give
suck
and
i
stand
on
the
tabl
thi
made
me
reflect
upon
the
fair
skin
of
our
english
ladi
who
appear
so
beauti
to
us
onli
becaus
they
are
of
our
own
size
and
their
defect
not
to
be
seen
but
through
a
magnifi
glass
where
we
find
by
experi
that
the
smoothest
and
whitest
skin
look
rough
and
coars
and
ill-colour
i
rememb
when
i
wa
at
lilliput
the
complexion
of
those
diminut
peopl
appear
to
me
the
fairest
in
the
world
and
talk
upon
thi
subject
with
a
person
of
learn
there
who
wa
an
intim
friend
of
mine
he
said
that
my
face
appear
much
fairer
and
smoother
when
he
look
on
me
from
the
ground
than
it
did
upon
a
nearer
view
when
i
took
him
up
in
my
hand
and
brought
him
close
which
he
confess
wa
at
first
a
veri
shock
sight
he
said
“he
could
discov
great
hole
in
my
skin
that
the
stump
of
my
beard
were
ten
time
stronger
than
the
bristl
of
a
boar
and
my
complexion
made
up
of
sever
colour
altogeth
disagreeable:”
although
i
must
beg
leav
to
say
for
myself
that
i
am
as
fair
as
most
of
my
sex
and
countri
and
veri
littl
sunburnt
by
all
my
travel
on
the
other
side
discours
of
the

in

court
he
use
to
tell
me
“one
had
freckl
anoth
too
wide
a
mouth
a
third
too
larg
a
nose;”
noth
of
which
i
wa
abl
to
distinguish
i
confess
thi
reflect
wa
obviou
enough
which
howev
i
could
not
forbear
lest
the
reader
might
think
those
vast
creatur
were
actual
deform
for
i
must
do
them
the
justic
to
say
they
are
a
come
race
of
peopl
and
particularli
the
featur
of
my
master’
counten
although
he
wa

when
i

from

i

perceiv
she
put

and
cover
me
with
a
clean
white
handkerchief
but
larger
and
coarser
than
the

of
a

of

i
slept
about
two
hour
and
dreamt
i
wa
at
home
with
my
wife
and
children
which
aggrav
my
sorrow
when
i
awak
and
found
myself
alon
in

between

hundr
feet
wide
and
abov
two

lie
in

twenti

my

me
to

up

and
ran
smell
backward
and
forward
on

one
of

came
up
almost
to
my

whereupon
i
rose
in
a
fright
and
drew
out
my
hanger
to
defend
myself
these
horribl
anim
had
the
bold
to
attack
me
on

and
one
of

held

but
i
had
the
good
fortun
to
rip
up
hi
belli
befor
he
could
do
me

he
fell
down
at

see
the
fate
of
hi
comrad
made
hi
escap
but
not
without
one
good
wound
on
the
back
which
i
gave
him
as
he
fled
and
made
the
blood
run
trickl
from
him
after
thi
exploit
i
walk
gentli
to
and
fro
on
the
bed
to
recov
my
breath
and
loss
of
spirit
these
creatur
were
of
the
size
of
a
larg
mastiff
but
infinit
more
nimbl
and
fierc
so
that
if
i
had
taken
off
my
belt
befor
i
went
to
sleep
i
must
have
infal
been
torn
to
piec
and
devour
i
measur
the
tail
of
the
dead
rat
and
found
it
to
be
two
yard
long
want
an
inch
but
it
went
against
my
stomach
to
drag
the
carcass
off
the
bed
where
it
lay
still
bleed
i
observ
it
had
yet
some
life
but
with
a
strong
slash
across
the
neck
i
thoroughli
despatch
it
soon
after
my
mistress
came
into
the
room
who
see
me
all
bloodi
ran
and
took
me
up
in
her
hand
i
point
to
the

smile
and
make

to
show
i

whereat

call
the

to
take
up
the

with

then
she
set
me
on

all
bloodi
and
wipe
it
on

i
wa
press
to
do
more
than
one
thing
which
anoth
could
not

for

and
therefor
endeavour
to
make
my

understand
that
i

which
after
she
had
done
my

would
not
suffer

observ

who

of

among

wa
hardli
so
great
a

as
a

would
be

i
then
said
to

i

not

a

the
queen
observ
my
cold
and
when
the
farmer
wa
gone
out
of
the
apart
ask
me
the
reason
i
made
bold
to
tell
her
majesti
“that
i

no

hi
not
dash
out

oblig
wa

recompens
by
the
gain
he
had
made
in
show
me
through
half
the

the
price
he
had
now
sold
me
for
that
the
life
i
had
sinc
led
wa
labori
enough
to
kill
an
anim
of
ten

my
strength
that
my
health
wa
much
impair
by
the
continu
drudgeri
of
entertain
the
rabbl
everi
hour
of
the
day
and
that
if
my
master
had
not
thought
my
life
in
danger
her
majesti
would
not
have
got
so
cheap
a
bargain
but
as
i
wa
out
of
all
fear

ill-treat
under

empress
the
ornament
of
natur
the

delight
of
her

the
phœnix
of

i
hope
my

would
appear
to
be
groundless
for
i
alreadi
found
my
spirit
reviv
by
the
influenc

wa
the
sum

my
speech
deliv
with
great
improprieti
and
hesit

in

so
clear
and
hi

so
exact
that
he
made
veri
wise
reflect
and
observ
upon
all
i
said
but
i
confess
that
after
i
had
been
a
littl
too
copiou
in
talk
of
my
own
belov
countri
of
our
trade
and
war
by

of
our
schism
in

and
parti
in

the
prejudic
of
hi
educ
prevail
so
far
that
he
could
not
forbear
take
me
up
in

and
stroke
me
gentli
with
the
other
after
a
hearti
fit
of
laugh
ask
me
“whether
i

then
turn
to
hi
first
minist
who
wait
behind
him
with
a
white
staff
near
as
tall
as
the
mainmast
of
the

he
observ
“how

which
could
be

say
he
“i

upon

that

from

i
cannot
but
conclud
that
our
geograph

are
in
a
great
error
by
suppos
noth
but
sea
between
japan
and
california
for
it
wa
ever
my
opinion
that
there
must
be
a
balanc
of
earth
to
counterpois
the
great
contin
of
tartari
and
therefor
they
ought
to
correct
their
map
and
chart
by
join
thi
vast
tract
of
land
to
the
north-west
part
of
america
wherein
i
shall
be
readi
to
lend
them
my
assist
the

a

a

of

which
are
altogeth

of

upon

neither
do
the

whether

it

there
is
not

the

the

gener
so
rough
that
there
is
no

that

but
the

full

abound
with
excel
fish
for
they
seldom

the

the
most
horribl
spectacl
that
ever

there
wa
a

i
could
see
distinctli
the

much
better

lous
through

they
root
like

they
were
the

to

that
i
wa
carri
between
hi

without
the

hush
up
and
never
known
at
court
for
the
girl
wa
afraid
of
the
queen’
anger
and
truli
as
to
myself
i
thought
it
would
not
be
for
my
reput
that
such
a
stori
should
go
about
thi
accid
absolut
determin
glumdalclitch
never
to
trust
me
abroad
for
the
futur
out
of
her
sight
i
had
been
long
afraid
of
thi
resolut
and
therefor
conceal
from
her
some
littl
unlucki
adventur
that
happen
in
those
time
when
i
wa
left
by
myself
onc
a
kite
hover
over
the
garden
made
a
stoop
at
me
and
if
i
had
not
resolut
drawn
my
hanger
and
run
under
a
thick
espali
he
would
have
certainli
carri
me
away
in
hi
talon
anoth
time
walk
to
the
top
of
a
fresh
mole-hil
i
fell
to
my
neck
in
the
hole
through
which
that
anim
had
cast
up
the
earth
and
coin
some
lie
not
worth
rememb
to
excus
myself
for
spoil
my
cloth
i
likewis
broke
my
right
shin
against
the
shell
of
a
snail
which
i
happen
to
stumbl
over
as
i
wa
walk
alon
and
think
on
poor
england
i
cannot
tell
whether
i
were
more
pleas
or
mortifi
to
observ
in
those
solitari
walk
that
the
smaller
bird
did
not
appear
to
be
at
all
afraid
of
me
but
would
hop
about
within
a
yard’
distanc
look
for
worm
and
other
food
with
as
much
indiffer
and
secur
as
if
no
creatur
at
all
were
near
them
i
rememb
a
thrush
had
the
confid
to
snatch
out
of
my
hand
with
hi
bill
a
piec
of
cake
that
glumdalclitch
had
just
given
me
for
my
breakfast
when
i
attempt
to
catch
ani
of
these
bird
they
would
boldli
turn
against
me
endeavour
to
peck
my
finger
which
i
durst
not
ventur
within
their
reach
and
then
they
would
hop
back
unconcern
to
hunt
for
worm
or
snail
as
they
did
befor
but
one
day
i
took
a
thick
cudgel
and
threw
it
with
all
my
strength
so
luckili
at
a
linnet
that
i
knock
him
down
and
seiz
him
by
the
neck
with
both
my
hand
ran
with
him
in
triumph
to
my
nurs
howev
the
bird
who
had
onli
been
stun
recov
himself
gave
me
so
mani
box
with
hi
wing
on
both
side
of
my
head
and
bodi
though
i
held
him
at
arm’
length
and
wa
out
of
the
reach
of
hi
claw
that
i
wa
twenti
time
think
to
let
him
go
but
i
wa
soon
reliev
by
one
of
our
servant
who
wrung
off
the
bird’
neck
and
i
had
him
next
day
for
dinner
by
the
queen’
command
thi
linnet
as
near
as
i
can
rememb
seem
to
be
somewhat
larger
than
an
english
swan
the
maid
of
honour
often
invit
glumdalclitch
to
their
apart
and
desir
she
would
bring
me
along
with
her
on
purpos
to
have
the
pleasur
of
see
and
touch
me
they
would
often
strip
me
nake
from
top
to
toe
and
lay
me
at
full
length
in
their
bosom
wherewith
i
wa
much
disgust
becaus
to
say
the
truth
a
veri
offens
smell
came
from
their
skin
which
i
do
not
mention
or
intend
to
the
disadvantag
of
those
excel
ladi
for
whom
i
have
all
manner
of
respect
but
i
conceiv
that
my
sens
wa
more
acut
in
proport
to
my
littl
and
that
those
illustri
person
were
no
more
disagre
to
their
lover
or
to
each
other
than
peopl
of
the
same
qualiti
are
with
us
in
england
and
after
all
i
found
their
natur
smell
wa
much
more
support
than
when
they
use
perfum
under
which
i
immedi
swoon
away
i
cannot
forget
that
an
intim
friend
of
mine
in
lilliput
took
the
freedom
in
a
warm
day
when
i
had
use
a
good
deal
of
exercis
to
complain
of
a
strong
smell
about
me
although
i
am
as
littl
faulti
that
way
as
most
of
my
sex
but
i
suppos
hi
faculti
of
smell
wa
as
nice
with
regard
to
me
as
mine
wa
to
that
of
thi
peopl
upon
thi
point
i
cannot
forbear
do
justic
to
the
queen
my
mistress
and
glumdalclitch
my
nurs
whose
person
were
as
sweet
as
those
of
ani
ladi
in
england
that
which
gave
me
most
uneasi
among
these
maid
of
honour
when
my
nurs
carri
me
to
visit
them
wa
to
see
them
use
me
without
ani
manner
of
ceremoni
like
a
creatur
who
had
no
sort
of
consequ
for
they
would
strip
themselv
to
the
skin
and
put
on
their
smock
in
my
presenc
while
i
wa
place
on
their
toilet
directli
befor
their

bodi
which
i
am
sure
to
me
wa
veri
far
from
be
a
tempt
sight
or
from
give
me
ani
other
emot
than
those
of
horror
and
disgust
their
skin
appear
so
coars
and
uneven
so
various
colour
when
i
saw
them
near
with
a
mole
here
and
there
as
broad
as
a
trencher
and
hair
hang
from
it
thicker
than
packthread
to
say
noth
farther
concern
the
rest
of
their
person
neither
did
they
at
all
scrupl
while
i
wa
by
to
discharg
what
they
had
drank
to
the
quantiti
of
at

the

will
excus

as
for

although
i
abhor
such

yet
my
curios
tempt
me
to
see
someth
that
i
thought

the

wa
fix
in
a
chair
upon
a

gave
such
a
bounc
as
made
me
start
although
i
wa
at

half
an

the
queen
who
often
use

hear
me
talk
of

whether

yet
often
upon

forc
to
work

but
i
could
not
see
how
thi
could
be
done
in
their
countri
where
the
smallest

wa
equal
to
a
first-rat
man
of

and
such
a

he
squeez
me
so
hard
that
i
thought
it
more
prudent
to

i
have
good
reason
to

sat
for
some
time
five
hundr
yard
from
the
ground
expect
everi
moment
to
be
blown
down
by
the
wind
or
to
fall
by
my
own
giddi
and
come
tumbl
over
and
over
from
the
ridg
to
the
eav
but
an
honest
lad
one
of
my
nurse’
footmen
climb
up
and
put
me
into
hi
breech
pocket
brought
me
down
safe
i
wa
almost
choke
with
the
filthi
stuff
the
monkey
had
cram
down
my
throat
but
my
dear
littl
nurs
pick
it
out
of
my
mouth
with
a
small
needl
and
then
i
fell
a-vomit
which
gave
me
great
relief
yet
i
wa
so
weak
and
bruis
in
the
side
with
the
squeez
given
me
by
thi
odiou
anim
that
i
wa
forc
to
keep
my
bed
a
fortnight
the
king
queen
and
all
the
court
sent
everi
day
to
inquir
after
my
health
and
her
majesti
made
me
sever
visit
dure
my
sick
the
monkey
wa
kill
and
an
order
made
that
no
such
anim
should
be
kept
about
the
palac
when
i
attend
the
king
after
my
recoveri
to
return
him
thank
for
hi
favour
he
wa
pleas
to
ralli
me
a
good
deal
upon
thi
adventur
he
ask
me
“what
my
thought
and
specul
were
while
i
lay
in
the
monkey’
paw
how
i
like
the
victual
he
gave
me
hi
manner
of
feed
and
whether
the
fresh
air
on
the
roof
had
sharpen
my
stomach.”
he
desir
to
know
“what
i
would
have
done
upon
such
an
occas
in
my
own
country.”
i
told
hi
majesti
“that
in
europ
we
had
no
monkey
except
such
as
were
brought
for
curios
from
other
place
and
so
small
that
i
could
deal
with
a
dozen
of
them
togeth
if
they
presum
to
attack
me
and
as
for
that
monstrou
anim
with
whom
i
wa
so
late
engag
it
wa
inde
as
larg
as
an
eleph
if
my
fear
had
suffer
me
to
think
so
far
as
to
make
use
of
my
hanger,”
look
fierc
and
clap
my
hand
on
the
hilt
as
i
spoke
“when
he
poke
hi
paw
into
my
chamber
perhap
i
should
have
given
him
such
a
wound
as
would
have
made
him
glad
to
withdraw
it
with
more
hast
than
he
put
it
in.”
thi
i
deliv
in
a
firm
tone
like
a

wa
jealou
lest

all

made
me
reflect
how

to
endeavour
to
do
himself
honour
among
those
who
are
out

i
made
a

of

some

a

that
i
would
entertain

but
thi
appear
extrem
difficult
for

that
by

about
four

and
i

i
ran
sidel
upon

and
thi
as
fast
as
i

with

made
a

to
play
a

would
frequent
order
that
i
should

brought
in

he
would
then
command

out
of

and
sit
down
within
three
yard
distanc
upon

brought
me
almost
to
a
level
with
hi
face
in
thi
manner
i
had
sever
convers
with
him
i
one
day
took
the
freedom
to
tell
hi
majesti
“that
the

discov
toward

the

of

did
not
seem

to

did
not

itself
with

took
me
to

i
might

the
king
heard
me
with
attent
and
began
to
conceiv
a
much
better
opinion
of
me
than
he
had
ever
befor

desir

the
book
treat
of
the
weak
of
humankind
and
is
in
littl
esteem
except
among
the
women
and
the
vulgar
howev
i
wa
curiou
to
see
what
an
author
of
that
countri
could
say
upon
such
a
subject
thi
writer
went
through
all
the
usual
topic
of
european
moralist
show
“how
diminut
contempt
and
helpless
an
anim
wa
man
in
hi
own
natur
how
unabl
to
defend
himself
from
inclem
of
the
air
or
the
furi
of
wild
beast
how
much
he
wa
excel
by
one
creatur
in
strength
by
anoth
in
speed
by
a
third
in
foresight
by
a
fourth
in
industry.”
he
ad
“that
natur
wa
degener
in
these
latter
declin
age
of
the
world
and
could
now
produc
onli
small
abort
birth
in
comparison
of
those
in
ancient
times.”
he
said
“it
wa
veri
reason
to
think
not
onli
that
the
speci
of
men
were
origin
much
larger
but
also
that
there
must
have
been
giant
in
former
age
which
as
it
is
assert
by
histori
and
tradit
so
it
ha
been
confirm
by
huge
bone
and
skull
casual
dug
up
in
sever
part
of
the
kingdom
far
exceed
the
common
dwindl
race
of
men
in
our
days.”
he
argu
“that
the
veri
law
of
natur
absolut
requir
we
should
have
been
made
in
the
begin
of
a
size
more
larg
and
robust
not
so
liabl
to
destruct
from
everi
littl
accid
of
a
tile
fall
from
a
hous
or
a
stone
cast
from
the
hand
of
a
boy
or
be
drown
in
a
littl
brook.”
from
thi
way
of
reason
the
author
drew
sever
moral
applic
use
in
the
conduct
of
life
but
needless
here
to
repeat
for
my
own
part
i
could
not
avoid
reflect
how
univers
thi
talent
wa
spread
of
draw
lectur
in
moral
or
inde
rather
matter
of
discont
and
repin
from
the
quarrel
we
rais
with
natur
and
i
believ
upon
a
strict
inquiri
those
quarrel
might
be
shown
as
ill-ground
among
us
as
they
are
among
that
peopl
as
to
their

affair
they
boast
that
the

of

i
had
order
a

to
be
fix

rope
from

at

to
break
the
jolt
when

would
often
sleep

while

on

not

over

i
order

to
cut
out
a

of

to
give
me
air
in
hot
weather
as
i
slept
which
hole
i
shut
at
pleasur
with
a
board
that
drew
backward
and
forward
through
a
groov
when
we
came
to
our
journey’
end
the
king
thought
proper
to
pass
a

day
at
a

he
ha
near
flanflasn
a
citi
within
eighteen
english
mile
of

glumdalclitch
and
i
were
much
fatigu
i
had
gotten
a
small
cold
but
the
poor
girl
wa
so
ill
as
to
be
confin
to
her
chamber
i
long
to
see
the
ocean
which
must
be
the
onli
scene
of
my
escap
if
ever
it
should
happen
i
pretend
to
be
wors
than
i
realli
wa
and
desir
leav
to
take
the
fresh
air
of
the
sea
with
a
page
whom
i
wa
veri
fond
of
and
who
had
sometim
been
trust
with
me
i
shall
never
forget
with
what
unwilling
glumdalclitch
consent
nor
the
strict
charg
she
gave
the
page
to
be
care
of
me
burst
at
the
same
time
into
a
flood
of
tear
as
if
she
had
some
forbod
of
what
wa
to
happen
the
boy
took
me
out
in
my
box
about
half
an
hour’
walk
from
the
palac
toward
the
rock
on
the
sea-shor
i
order
him
to
set
me
down
and
lift
up
one
of
my
sash
cast
mani
a
wist
melancholi
look
toward
the
sea
i
found
myself
not
veri
well
and
told
the
page
that
i
had
a
mind
to
take
a
nap
in
my
hammock
which
i
hope
would
do
me
good
i
got
in
and
the
boy
shut
the
window
close
down
to
keep
out
the
cold
i
soon
fell
asleep
and
all
i
can
conjectur
is
while
i
slept
the
page
think
no
danger
could
happen
went
among
the
rock
to
look
for
birds’
egg
have
befor
observ
him
from
my
window
search
about
and
pick
up
one
or
two
in
the
cleft
be
that
as
it
will
i
found
myself
suddenli
awak
with
a
violent
pull
upon
the
ring
which
wa
fasten
at
the
top
of
my
box
for
the
conveni
of
carriag
i
felt
my
box
rais
veri
high
in
the
air
and
then
born
forward
with
prodigi
speed
the
first
jolt
had
like
to
have
shaken
me
out
of
my
hammock
but
afterward
the
motion
wa
easi
enough
i
call
out
sever
time
as
loud
as
i
could
rais
my
voic
but
all
to
no
purpos
i
look
toward
my
window
and
could
see
noth
but
the
cloud
and
sky
i
heard
a
nois
just
over
my
head
like
the
clap
of
wing
and
then
began
to
perceiv
the
woful
condit
i
wa
in
that
some
eagl
had
got
the
ring
of
my
box
in
hi
beak
with
an
intent
to
let
it
fall
on
a
rock
like
a
tortois
in
a
shell
and
then
pick
out
my
bodi
and
devour
it
for
the
sagac
and
smell
of

bird
enabl
him
to
discov
hi

at

though
better
conceal
than
i
could
be
within
a
two-inch
board
in
a
littl
time
i
observ
the
nois
and
flutter
of
wing
to
increas
veri
fast
and
my
box
wa
toss
up
and
down
like
a
sign
in
a
windi
day
i
heard
sever
bang
or
buffet
as
i
thought
given
to
the
eagl
for
such
i
am
certain
it
must
have
been
that
held
the
ring
of
my
box
in
hi
beak
and
then
all
on
a
sudden
felt
myself
fall
perpendicularli
down
for
abov
a
minut
but
with
such
incred
swift
that
i
almost
lost
my
breath
my
fall
wa
stop
by
a
terribl
squash
that
sound
louder
to
my
ear
than
the
cataract
of
niagara
after
which
i
wa
quit
in
the
dark
for
anoth
minut
and
then
my
box
began
to
rise
so
high
that
i
could
see
light
from
the
top
of
the
window
i
now
perceiv
i
wa
fallen
into
the

my

by
the
weight
of
my

were
in

at

four
corner
of

about
five
feet
deep

so
tight

i
may
say
with
truth
that
in
the

could
not
forbear
lament
my

the

which
otherwis
i

or
at
least
thought
i
heard
some
kind
of
grate
nois
on
that
side
of
my
box
where
the
stapl
were
fix
and
soon
after
i
began
to
fanci
that
the
box
wa
pull
or
tow
along
the
sea
for
i
now
and
then
felt
a
sort
of
tug
which
made
the
wave
rise
near
the
top
of
my
window
leav
me
almost
in
the
dark
thi
gave
me
some
faint
hope
of
relief
although
i
wa
not
abl
to
imagin
how
it
could
be
brought
about
i
ventur
to
unscrew
one
of
my
chair
which
were
alway
fasten
to
the
floor
and
have
made
a
hard
shift
to
screw
it
down
again
directli
under
the
slipping-board
that
i
had
late
open
i
mount
on
the
chair
and
put
my
mouth
as
near
as
i
could
to
the
hole
i
call
for
help
in
a
loud
voic
and
in
all
the
languag
i
understood
i
then
fasten
my
handkerchief
to
a
stick
i
usual
carri
and
thrust
it
up
the
hole
wave
it
sever
time
in
the
air
that
if
ani
boat
or
ship
were
near
the
seamen
might
conjectur
some
unhappi
mortal
to
be
shut
up
in
the
box
i
found
no
effect
from
all
i
could
do
but
plainli
perceiv
my
closet
to
be
move
along
and
in
the
space
of
an
hour
or
better
that
side
of
the
box
where
the
stapl
were
and
had
no
window
struck
against
someth
that
wa
hard
i
apprehend
it
to
be
a
rock
and
found
myself
toss
more
than
ever
i
plainli
heard
a
nois
upon
the
cover
of
my
closet
like
that
of
a
cabl
and
the
grate
of
it
as
it
pass
through
the
ring
i
then
found
myself
hoist
up
by
degre
at
least
three
feet
higher
than
i
wa
befor
whereupon
i
again
thrust
up
my
stick
and
handkerchief
call
for
help
till
i
wa
almost
hoars
in
return
to
which
i
heard
a
great
shout
repeat
three
time
give
me
such
transport
of
joy
as
are
not
to
be
conceiv
but
by
those
who
feel
them
i
now
heard
a
trampl
over
my
head
and
somebodi
call
through
the
hole
with
a
loud
voic
in
the
english
tongu
“if
there
be
ani
bodi
below
let
them
speak.”
i
answer
“i
wa
an
englishman
drawn
by
ill
fortun
into
the
greatest
calam
that
ever
ani
creatur
underw
and
beg
by
all
that
wa
move
to
be
deliv
out
of
the
dungeon
i
wa
in.”
the
voic
repli
“i
wa
safe
for
my
box
wa
fasten
to
their
ship
and
the
carpent
should
immedi
come
and
saw
a
hole
in
the
cover
larg
enough
to
pull
me
out.”
i
answer
“that
wa
needless
and
would
take
up
too
much
time
for
there
wa
no
more
to
be
done
but
let
one
of
the
crew
put
hi
finger
into
the
ring
and
take
the
box
out
of
the
sea
into
the
ship
and
so
into
the
captain’
cabin.”
some
of
them
upon
hear
me
talk
so
wildli
thought
i
wa
mad
other
laugh
for
inde
it
never
came
into
my

that
i
wa
now
got
among
peopl
of
my

and
strength
the
carpent
came
and
in
a
few
minut
saw
a
passag
about
four
feet
squar
then
let
down
a
small
ladder
upon
which
i
mount
and
thenc
wa
taken
into
the
ship
in
a
veri
weak
condit
the
sailor
were
all
in

and
ask
me
a
thousand
question
which
i
had
no

strip
off

but
the

then
they
knock
off
some
of

and
when

by

of

and
the
danger
i
had
escap
howev
upon

i
found
myself
much
recov
it
wa
now
about
eight
o’clock
at

and
the

i
had
alreadi
fast
too

he
entertain
me
with
great

observ
me
not

and
when

alon
desir
i
would
give
him
a
relat
of
my
travel
and
by
what
accid
i
came
to
be
set
adrift
in
that
monstrou
wooden
chest
he
said
“that
about
twelv
o’clock
at
noon
as
he
wa
look
through
hi
glass
he
spi
it
at

it

to

in

of

begin
to
fall

that
upon
come
nearer
and
find
hi
error
he
sent
out
hi
long-boat
to
discov
what
it
wa
that
hi
men
came
back
in
a
fright
swear
they
had
seen
a
swim
hous
that
he
laugh
at
their
folli
and
went
himself
in
the
boat
order
hi
men
to
take
a
strong
cabl
along
with
them
that
the
weather
be
calm
he
row
round
me
sever
time
observ
my
window
and
wire
lattic
that
defend
them
that
he
discov
two
stapl
upon
one
side
which
wa
all
of
board
without
ani
passag
for
light
he
then
command
hi
men
to
row
up
to
that
side
and
fasten
a
cabl
to
one
of
the
stapl
order
them
to
tow
my
chest
as
they
call
it
toward
the
ship
when
it
wa
there
he
gave
direct
to
fasten
anoth
cabl
to
the
ring
fix
in
the
cover
and
to
rais
up
my
chest
with
pulley
which
all
the
sailor
were
not
abl
to
do
abov
two
or
three
feet.”
he
said
“they
saw
my
stick
and
handkerchief
thrust
out
of
the
hole
and
conclud
that
some
unhappi
man
must
be
shut
up
in
the
cavity.”
i
ask
“whether
he
or
the
crew
had
seen
ani
prodigi
bird
in
the
air
about
the
time
he
first
discov
me.”
to
which
he
answer
“that
discours
thi
matter
with
the
sailor
while
i
wa
asleep
one
of
them
said
he
had
observ
three
eagl
fli
toward
the
north
but
remark
noth
of
their
be
larger
than
the
usual
size:”
which
i
suppos
must
be
imput
to
the
great
height
they
were
at
and
he
could
not
guess
the
reason
of
my
question
i
then
ask
the
captain
“how
far
he
reckon
we
might
be
from
land?”
he
said
“bi
the
best
comput
he
could
make
we
were
at
least
a
hundr
leagues.”
i
assur
him
“that
he
must
be
mistaken
by
almost
half
for
i
had
not
left
the
countri
whenc
i
came
abov
two
hour
befor
i
drop
into
the
sea.”
whereupon
he
began
again
to
think
that
my
brain
wa
disturb
of
which
he
gave
me
a
hint
and
advis
me
to
go
to
bed
in
a
cabin
he
had
provid
i
assur
him
“i
wa
well
refresh
with
hi
good
entertain
and
compani
and
as
much
in
my
sens
as
ever
i
wa
in
my
life.”
he
then
grew
seriou
and
desir
to
ask
me
freeli
“whether
i
were
not
troubl
in
my
mind
by
the
conscious
of
some
enorm
crime
for
which
i
wa
punish
at

command
of
some
princ
by

me
in

as

been
forc
to

without

although
he
should
be
sorri
to
have
taken
so
ill
a

into
hi
ship
yet
he
would
engag
hi
word
to
set
me
safe
ashor
in
the
first
port
where
we
arrived.”
he
ad
“that
hi
suspicion
were
much
increas
by
some
veri
absurd
speech
i
had
deliv
at
first
to
hi
sailor
and
afterward
to
himself
in
relat
to
my
closet
or
chest
as
well
as
by
my
odd
look
and
behaviour
while
i
wa
at
supper.”
i
beg
hi
patienc
to
hear
me
tell
my
stori
which
i
faith
did
from
the
last
time
i
left
england
to
the
moment
he
first
discov
me
and
as

but
further
to
confirm
all
i

said
i
entreat
him
to
give
order
that

should

which
i

i
observ
him
to

with
great
curios
and
found
he

fanci
for

it
with
abund
of
thank

trifl
could

drawn
by
an
unskil
surgeon
in
a
mistak
from
one
of
glumdalclitch’
men
who
wa
afflict
with
the
tooth-ach
but
it
wa
as
sound
as
ani
in
hi
head
i
got
it
clean
and
put
it
into
my
cabinet
it
wa
about
a
foot
long
and
four
inch
in
diamet
the
captain
wa
veri
well
satisfi
with
thi
plain
relat
i
had
given
him
and
said
“he
hope
when
we
return
to
england
i
would
oblig
the
world
by
put
it
on
paper
and
make
it
public.”
my
answer
wa
“that
we
were
overstock
with
book
of
travel
that
noth
could
now
pass
which
wa
not
extraordinari
wherein
i
doubt
some
author
less
consult
truth
than
their
own
vaniti
or
interest
or
the
divers
of
ignor
reader
that
my
stori
could
contain
littl
besid
common
event
without
those
ornament
descript
of
strang
plant
tree
bird
and
other
anim
or
of
the
barbar
custom
and
idolatri
of
savag
peopl
with
which
most
writer
abound
howev
i
thank
him
for
hi
good
opinion
and
promis
to
take
the
matter
into
my
thoughts.”
he
said
“he
wonder
at
one
thing
veri
much
which
wa
to
hear
me
speak
so
loud;”
ask
me
“whether
the
king
or
queen
of
that
countri
were
thick
of
hearing?”
i
told
him
“it
wa
what
i
had
been
use
to
for
abov
two
year
past
and
that
i
admir
as
much
at
the
voic
of
him
and
hi
men
who
seem
to
me
onli
to
whisper
and
yet
i
could
hear
them
well
enough
but
when
i
spoke
in
that
countri
it
wa
like
a
man
talk
in
the
street
to
anoth
look
out
from
the
top
of
a
steepl
unless
when
i
wa
place
on
a
tabl
or
held
in
ani
person’
hand.”
i
told
him
“i
had
likewis
observ
anoth
thing
that
when
i
first
got
into
the
ship
and
the
sailor
stood
all
about
me
i
thought
they
were
the
most
littl
contempt
creatur
i
had
ever
beheld.”
for
inde
while
i
wa
in
that
prince’
countri
i
could
never
endur
to
look
in
a
glass
after
my
eye
had
been
accustom
to
such
prodigi
object
becaus
the
comparison
gave
me
so
despic
a
conceit
of
myself
the
captain
said
“that
while
we
were
at
supper
he
observ
me
to
look
at
everi
thing
with
a
sort
of
wonder
and
that
i
often
seem
hardli
abl
to
contain
my
laughter
which
he
knew
not
well
how
to
take
but
imput
it
to
some
disord
in
my
brain.”
i
answer
“it
wa
veri
true
and
i
wonder
how
i
could
forbear
when
i
saw
hi
dish
of
the
size
of
a
silver
three-penc
a
leg
of
pork
hardli
a
mouth
a
cup
not
so
big
as
a
nut-shell;”
and
so
i
went
on
describ
the
rest
of
hi
household-stuff
and
provis
after
the
same
manner
for
although
the
queen
had
order
a
littl
equipag
of
all
thing
necessari
for
me
while
i
wa
in
her
servic
yet
my
idea
were
wholli
taken
up
with
what
i
saw
on
everi
side
of
me
and
i
wink
at
my
own
littl
as
peopl
do
at
their
own
fault
the
captain
understood
my
railleri
veri
well
and
merrili
repli
with
the
old
english
proverb
“that
he
doubt
my
eye
were
bigger
than
my
belli
for
he
did
not
observ
my
stomach
so
good
although
i
had
fast
all
day;”
and
continu
in
hi
mirth
protest
“he
would
have
gladli
given
a
hundr
pound
to
have
seen
my
closet
in
the
eagle’
bill
and
afterward
in
it
fall
from
so
great
a
height
into
the
sea
which
would
certainli
have
been
a
most
astonish
object
worthi
to
have
the
descript
of
it
transmit
to
futur
ages:”
and
the
comparison
of
phaeton
wa
so
obviou
that
he
could
not
forbear
appli
it
although
i
did
not
much
admir
the
conceit
the
captain
have
been
at
tonquin
wa
in
hi
return
to
england
driven
north-eastward
to
the
latitud
of
44
degre
and

i
behav
myself

i
did
not
reach
it
in

than
five
hour
i
encompass
it
almost
round
befor
i
could
find
a
conveni
place
to

kept
me
awak
i
consid
how
imposs
it
wa
to
preserv
my
life
in
so
desol
a
place
and
how
miser
my
end
must
be
yet
found
myself
so
listless
and
despond
that
i
had
not
the
heart
to
rise
and
befor
i
could
get
spirit
enough
to
creep
out
of
my
cave
the
day
wa
far
advanc
i
walk
awhil
among
the
rock
the
sky
wa
perfectli
clear
and
the
sun
so
hot
that
i
wa
forc
to
turn
my

from
it
when
all
on
a
sudden
it
becam
obscur
as
i
thought
in

differ
from
what
happen
by
the
interposit
of

i
turn

and
perceiv
a

bodi
between

move
forward
toward
the
island
it
seem
to
be
about
two
mile
high
and
hid
the
sun
six
or
seven
minut
but
i
did
not
observ
the

to
be

colder
or
the

more
darken
than
if
i
had
stood
under
the
shade
of

i
wa
it
appear
to
be
a
firm
substanc
the
bottom
flat
smooth
and
shine
veri
bright
from
the
reflect
of
the
sea
below
i
stood
upon
a
height
about
two
hundr
yard
from
the
shore
and
saw
thi
vast
bodi
descend
almost
to
a
parallel
with
me
at
less
than
an
english
mile
distanc
i
took
out
my
pocket
perspect
and
could
plainli
discov
number
of
peopl
move
up
and
down
the
side
of
it
which
appear
to
be
slope
but
what
those
peopl
were
do
i
wa
not
abl
to
distinguish
the
natur
love
of
life
gave
me
some
inward
motion
of
joy
and
i
wa
readi
to
entertain
a
hope
that
thi
adventur
might
some
way
or
other
help
to
deliv
me
from
the
desol
place
and
condit
i
wa
in
but
at
the
same
time
the
reader
can
hardli
conceiv
my
astonish
to
behold
an
island
in
the
air
inhabit
by
men
who
were
abl
as
it
should
seem
to
rais
or
sink
or
put
it
into
progress
motion
as
they
pleas
but
not
be
at
that
time
in
a
disposit
to
philosophis
upon
thi
phenomenon
i
rather
chose
to
observ
what
cours
the
island
would
take
becaus
it
seem
for
a
while
to
stand
still
yet
soon
after
it
advanc
nearer
and
i
could
see
the
side
of
it
encompass
with
sever
gradat
of
galleri
and
stair
at
certain
interv
to
descend
from
one
to
the

in
the
lowest
galleri
i
beheld
some
peopl
fish
with
long
angl
rod
and
other
look
on
i
wave
my
cap
for
my
hat
wa
long
sinc
worn
out
and
my
handkerchief
toward
the
island
and
upon
it
nearer
approach
i
call
and
shout
with
the
utmost
strength
of
my
voic
and
then
look
circumspectli
i
beheld
a
crowd
gather
to
that
side
which
wa
most
in
my
view
i
found
by
their
point
toward
me
and
to
each
other
that
they
plainli
discov
me
although
they
made
no
return
to
my
shout
but
i
could
see
four
or
five
men
run
in
great
hast
up
the
stair
to
the
top
of
the
island
who
then
disappear
i
happen
rightli
to
conjectur
that
these
were
sent
for

to
some
person

upon
thi

with

when

he
ask

the

therebi
made

becaus

would
turn

said
“that

further
“that

whereof
i

convinc

he
told

he
had

we
cross

said
the

took
up

he
said
“perhap

the

he
then
led

then
desir
me

the

at

took

six

the

show

howev
might
be
still

much
expedit
if
the

would
rais

employ
five
hundr
such

in

and
oblig
the
manag
to
contribut
in
common
their
sever

he
assur
me
“that
thi
invent
had
employ
all
hi
thought
from
hi
youth
that
he
had
empti
the
whole
vocabulari
into

made
the
strictest
comput
of
the
gener
proport
there
is
in

between
the
number
of

noun

i
made
my
humblest
acknowledg
to
thi
illustri
person
for
hi
great
commun
and
promis
“if
ever
i
had
the

the
form
and
contriv
of
which
i
desir
leav
to
delin
on
paper
as
in
the
figur
here
annex
i
told
him
“although
it
were
the
custom
of
our

in

to
steal
invent
from

had
therebi
at

thi
advantag
that
it
becam
a

which
wa
the
right
owner
yet
i
would
take
such
caution
that

should
have
the
honour
entir
without

we
next
went
to
the
school
of

where
three
professor
sat
in
consult
upon

of
their

leav
out

participl

in
realiti
all

imagin
are
but
norm
the
other
project
wa
a
scheme
for
entir
abolish
all
word
whatsoev
and
thi
wa
urg
as
a
great
advantag
in
point
of
health
as
well
as
breviti
for
it
is
plain
that
everi
word
we
speak
is
in
some
degre
a
diminut
of
our
lung
by
corros

consequ
contribut

the

assur

from

i
heard
a

money
without

first
affirm

the
second
wa

an
opinion

contrari

soon
grew
so
familiar
to

must
be

might

upon

i
made

who
were

one

on

propos
that
homer
and

might
appear
at

of

these
were
so
numer
that
some

were
forc
to

of

i
knew
and
could
distinguish
those
two
hero
at

sight
not
onli
from

from

were
the
most

i
ever
beheld
aristotl
stoop
much
and
made
use
of
a
staff
hi
visag
wa
meagr
hi
hair
lank
and
thin
and
hi
voic
hollow
i
soon
discov
that
both
of
them
were
perfect
stranger
to
the
rest
of
the
compani
and
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
them
befor
and
i
had
a
whisper
from
a
ghost
who
shall
be
nameless
“that
these
comment
alway
kept
in
the
most
distant
quarter
from
their
princip
in

through
a
conscious
of
shame
and
guilt
becaus
they
had
so
horribl
misrepres
the

author
to
posterity.”
i
introduc
didymu
and
eustathiu
to
homer
and
prevail
on
him
to
treat
them
better
than
perhap
they
deserv
for
he
soon
found
they
want
a
geniu
to
enter
into
the
spirit
of
a
poet
but
aristotl
wa
out
of
all
patienc
with
the
account
i
gave
him
of
scotu
and
ramu
as
i
present
them
to
him
and
he
ask
them
“whether
the
rest
of
the
tribe
were
as
great
dunc
as
themselves?”
i
then
desir
the
governor
to
call
up
descart
and
gassendi
with
whom
i
prevail
to
explain
their
system
to
aristotl
thi
great
philosoph
freeli
acknowledg
hi
own
mistak
in

becaus
he
proceed
in
mani
thing
upon
conjectur
as
all
men
must
do
and
he
found
that
gassendi
who
had
made
the
doctrin
of
epicuru
as
palat
as
he
could
and
the
vortic
of
descart
were
equal
to
be
explod
he
predict
the
same
fate
to
attract
whereof
the
present
learn
are
such
zealou
assert
he
said
“that
new

of

but
new

which
would
vari

even
those

i
had
the
curios
to

by

i

i

upon

a

upon

discov
such
a

that
i
cannot
reflect

without
some
serious
perjuri
oppress
suborn
fraud
pandar
and
the
like

were
among
the
most

they
had
to

for

i

as
it

great

when

confess
they

i
may
be

if
these
discoveri
inclin
me
a
littl
to
abat
of
that
profound
vener
which
i
am
natur
apt
to
pay
to
person
of
high
rank
who
ought
to
be
treat
with
the
utmost
respect
due
to
their
sublim
digniti
by
us
their
inferior
i
had
often
read
of
some
great
servic
done
to
princ
and
state
and
desir
to
see
the
person
by
whom
those
servic
were
perform
upon
inquiri
i
wa
told
“that
their
name
were
to
be
found
on
no
record
except
a
few
of
them
whom
histori
ha
repres
as
the
vilest
of
rogu
and
traitors.”
as
to
the
rest
i
had
never
onc
heard
of
them
they
all
appear
with
deject
look
and
in
the
meanest
habit
most
of
them
tell
me
“they
die
in
poverti
and
disgrac
and
the
rest
on
a
scaffold
or
a
gibbet.”
among
other
there
wa
one
person
whose
case
appear
a
littl
singular
he
had
a
youth
about
eighteen
year
old
stand
by
hi
side
he
told
me
“he
had
for
mani
year
been
command
of
a
ship
and
in
the
sea
fight
at
actium
had
the
good
fortun
to
break
through
the
enemy’
great
line
of
battl
sink
three
of
their
capit
ship
and
take
a
fourth
which
wa
the
sole
caus
of
antony’
flight
and
of
the
victori
that
ensu
that
the
youth
stand
by
him
hi
onli
son
wa
kill
in
the
action.”
he
ad
“that
upon
the
confid
of
some
merit
the
war
be
at
an
end
he
went
to
rome
and
solicit
at
the
court
of
augustu
to
be
prefer
to
a
greater
ship
whose
command
had
been
kill
but
without
ani
regard
to
hi
pretens
it
wa
given
to
a
boy
who
had
never
seen
the
sea
the
son
of
libertina
who
wait
on
one
of
the
emperor’
mistress
return
back
to
hi
own
vessel
he
wa
charg
with
neglect
of
duti
and
the
ship
given
to
a
favourit
page
of
publicola
the
vice-admir
whereupon
he
retir
to
a
poor
farm
at
a
great
distanc
from
rome
and
there
end
hi
life.”
i
wa
so
curiou
to
know
the
truth
of
thi
stori
that
i
desir
agrippa
might
be
call
who
wa
admir
in
that
fight
he
appear
and
confirm
the
whole
account
but
with
much
more
advantag
to
the
captain
whose
modesti
had
extenu
or
conceal
a
great
part
of
hi
merit
i
wa
surpris
to
find
corrupt
grown
so
high

so
quick
in
that
empir
by
the
forc
of
luxuri
so
late

which
made
me
less
wonder
at
mani
parallel
case
in

countri
where
vice
of

reign
so
much
longer
and
where
the
whole

the

it

would

meant
by

he
told
me
“that

the

as

describ
it
“wa
about

he
said
“these

did
not

there
could

i
freeli
own
myself
to
have
been

it

i

to

as
he
could
that
the

had
still
hope
of

one

longer
and
look
on
death
as
the
greatest
evil
from
which
natur
alway
prompt
him
to
retreat
onli
in

island
of

the
appetit
for
live
wa
not
so
eager
from
the
continu
exampl
of

befor
their
eye
“that

wa
not
whether

how
he
would
pass
a

bring
along
with

avow

in

he

after
thi
prefac
he
gave
me
a
particular
account
of
the
struldbrug
among
them
he
said
“they

thi
wa
the
account
given
me
of
the
struldbrug
as
near
as
i
can
rememb
i
afterward
saw
five
or
six
of
differ
age
the
youngest
not
abov
two
hundr
year
old
who
were
brought
to
me
at
sever
time
by
some
of
my
friend
but
although
they
were
told
“that
i
wa
a
great
travel
and
had
seen
all
the
world,”
they
had
not
the
least
curios
to
ask
me
a
question
onli
desir
“i
would
give
them
slumskudask_,”
or
a
token
of
remembr
which
is
a
modest
way
of
beg
to
avoid
the
law
that
strictli
forbid
it
becaus
they
are
provid
for
by
the
public
although
inde
with
a
veri
scanti
allow
they
are
despis
and
hate
by
all
sort
of
peopl
when
one
of
them
is
born
it
is
reckon
omin
and
their
birth
is
record
veri
particularli
so
that
you
may
know
their
age
by
consult
the
regist
which
howev
ha
not
been
kept
abov
a
thousand
year
past
or
at
least
ha
been
destroy
by
time
or
public
disturb
but
the
usual
way
of
comput
how
old
they
are
is
by
ask
them
what
king
or
great
person
they
can
rememb
and
then
consult
histori
for
infal
the
last
princ
in
their
mind
did
not
begin
hi
reign
after
they
were
fourscor
year
old
they
were
the
most
mortifi
sight
i
ever
beheld
and
the
women
more
horribl
than
the
men
besid
the
usual
deform
in
extrem
old
age
they
acquir
an
addit
ghastli
in
proport
to
their
number
of
year
which
is
not
to
be
describ
and
among
half
a
dozen
i
soon
distinguish
which
wa
the
eldest
although
there
wa
not
abov
a
centuri
or
two
between
them
the
reader
will
easili
believ
that
from
what
i
had
heard
and
seen
my
keen
appetit
for
perpetu
of
life
wa
much
abat
i
grew
heartili
asham
of
the
pleas
vision
i
had
form
and
thought
no
tyrant
could
invent
a
death
into
which
i
would
not
run
with
pleasur
from
such
a
life
the
king
heard
of
all
that
had
pass
between
me
and
my
friend
upon
thi
occas
and
ralli
me
veri
pleasantli
wish
i
could
send
a
coupl
of
struldbrug
to
my
own
countri
to
arm
our
peopl
against
the
fear
of
death
but
thi
it
seem
is
forbidden
by
the
fundament
law
of
the
kingdom
or
els
i
should
have
been
well
content
with
the
troubl
and
expens
of
transport
them
i
could
not
but
agre
that
the
law
of
thi
kingdom
rel
to
the
struldbrug
were
found
upon
the
strongest
reason
and
such
as
ani
other
countri
would
be
under
the
necess
of
enact
in
the
like
circumst
otherwis
as
avaric
is
the
necessari
consequ
of
old
age
those
immort
would
in

becom
proprietor
of
the
whole
nation
and
engross
the
civil
power
which
for
want
of
abil
to
manag
must
end
in
the
ruin
of
the
public
chapter
xi
the
author
leav
luggnagg
and
sail
to
japan
from
thenc
he
return
in
a
dutch
ship
to
amsterdam
and
from
amsterdam
to
england
i
thought
thi
account
of
the
struldbrug
might
be
some
entertain
to
the
reader
becaus
it
seem
to
be
a
littl
out
of
the
common
way
at
least
i
do
not
rememb
to
have
met
the
like
in
ani
book
of
travel
that
ha
come
to
my
hand
and
if
i
am
deceiv
my
excus
must
be
that
it
is
necessari
for
travel
who
describ
the
same
countri
veri
often
to
agre
in
dwell
on
the
same
particular
without
deserv
the
censur
of
have
borrow
or
transcrib
from
those
who
wrote
befor
them
there
is
inde
a
perpetu
commerc
between
thi
kingdom
and
the
great
empir
of
japan
and
it
is
veri
probabl
that
the
japanes
author
may
have
given
some
account
of
the
struldbrug
but
my
stay
in
japan
wa
so
short
and
i
wa
so
entir
a
stranger
to

that
i
wa
not

i
hope
the

upon
thi
notic
will
be
curiou

abl
enough
to
suppli

deliv

wa
open
with

explain

gave

thi
interpret
wa
a
person
employ
to
transact

with

he
soon
conjectur
by
my
counten
that
i
wa
a

and
therefor
repeat
hi
majesty’
command
in
low
dutch
which
he
spoke
perfectli
well
i
answer
as
i
had
befor
determin
“that

with

i

therefor
most

entreat

to
thi
i
ad
anoth
petit
“that
for

when
thi

petit
wa
interpret

he
seem

said
“he

ridg
of

down
their

and
the
fore

of
their

and
feet
but
the
rest
of
their
bodi
wa
bare
so
that
i
might
see
their
skin
which
were
of
a
brown
buff
colour
they
had
no
tail
nor
ani
hair
at
all
on
their
buttock
except
about
the
anu
which
i
presum
natur
had
place
there
to
defend
them
as
they
sat
on
the
ground
for
thi
postur
they
use
as
well
as
lie
down
and
often
stood
on
their
hind
feet
they
climb
high

as

as

for
they
had
strong

conceiv
so
strong
an

so
that
think
i
had
seen
enough
full
of
contempt
and
avers
i
got
up
and
pursu
the
beaten
road
hope
it
might
direct
me
to
the
cabin
of
some
indian
i
had
not
got
far
when
i
met
one
of
these
creatur
full
in
my

and
come
up
directli
to
me
the
ugli
monster
when
he
saw
me
distort

had
never

befor
then
approach
nearer
lift
up
hi
fore-paw
whether
out
of
curios
or
mischief
i
could
not
tell
but
i
drew
my
hanger
and
gave
him
a
good
blow
with
the
flat
side
of
it
for
i
durst
not
strike
with
the
edg
fear
the
inhabit
might
be
provok
against
me
if
they
should
come
to
know
that
i
had
kill
or
maim
ani
of
their
cattl
when
the
beast
felt
the
smart
he
drew
back
and
roar
so
loud
that
a
herd
of
at
least
forti
came
flock
about
me
from
the
next
field
howl
and
make
odiou
face
but
i
ran
to
the
bodi
of
a
tree
and
lean
my

against
it
kept
them
off
by
wave
my
hanger
sever
of
thi

get
hold
of
the
branch
behind
leap
up
into
the

whenc
they
began
to
discharg
their
excrement
on
my
head
howev
i
escap
pretti
well
by
stick
close
to
the
stem
of
the
tree
but
wa
almost
stifl
with
the
filth
which
fell
about
me
on
everi
side
in
the
midst
of
thi
distress
i
observ
them
all
to
run
away
on
a
sudden
as
fast
as
they
could
at
which
i
ventur
to
leav
the
tree
and
pursu
the
road
wonder
what
it
wa
that
could
put
them
into
thi
fright
but
look
on
my
left
hand
i
saw
a
hors
walk
softli
in
the
field
which
my
persecutor
have
sooner
discov
wa
the
caus
of
their
flight
the
hors

a
littl
when
he
came
near

but
soon
recov
himself

full
in

with
manifest
token
of
wonder
he
view
my

and

walk
round
me
sever

i
would
have
pursu
my
journey
but
he
place
himself
directli
in
the
way
yet
look
with
a
veri
mild
aspect
never
offer
the
least
violenc
we
stood
gaze
at
each
other
for
some
time
at
last
i
took
the
bold
to
reach
my
hand
toward
hi
neck
with
a
design
to
stroke
it
use
the
common
style
and
whistl
of
jockey
when
they
are
go
to
handl
a
strang
hors
but
thi
anim
seem
to
receiv
my
civil
with
disdain
shook
hi
head
and
bent
hi

softli
rais
up
hi
right
fore-foot
to
remov
my

then
he
neigh
three
or
four
time
but
in
so
differ
a
cadenc
that
i
almost
began
to
think
he
wa
speak
to
himself
in
some
languag
of
hi
own
while
he
and
i
were
thu
employ
anoth
hors
came
up
who
appli
himself
to
the

in
a

formal
manner
they
gentli
struck
each

right

befor
neigh
sever

by
turn
and
vari
the
sound
which
seem
to
be
almost
articul
they
went
some
pace
off
as
if
it
were
to
confer
togeth
walk
side
by
side
backward
and
forward
like
person
deliber
upon
some
affair
of
weight
but
often
turn
their
eye
toward
me
as
it
were
to
watch
that
i
might
not
escap
i
wa
amaz
to
see
such
action
and
behaviour
in
brute
beast
and
conclud
with
myself
that
if
the
inhabit
of
thi
countri
were
endu
with
a
proportion
degre
of
reason
they
must
need
be
the
wisest
peopl
upon

thi
thought
gave
me
so
much
comfort
that
i
resolv
to
go
forward
until
i
could
discov
some

or

observ
me
to
steal
off
neigh
after
me
in
so
express
a
tone
that
i
fanci
myself
to
understand
what
he
meant
whereupon
i
turn
back
and
came
near
to
him
to
expect
hi
farther
command
but
conceal
my
fear
as
much
as
i
could
for
i
began
to
be
in
some
pain
how
thi
adventur
might
termin
and
the
reader
will
easili
believ
i
did
not
much
like
my
present
situat
the
two
hors
came
up
close
to
me
look
with
great
earnest
upon
my
face
and
hand
the
gray
steed
rub
my
hat
all
round
with
hi
right
fore-hoof
and
discompos
it
so
much
that
i
wa
forc
to
adjust
it
better
by
take
it
off
and
settl
it
again
whereat
both
he
and
hi
companion
who
wa
a

appear
to
be
much
surpris
the

felt
the
lappet
of

find
it
to
hang
loos
about

they
both
look
with
new
sign
of
wonder
he
stroke
my

seem
to
admir
the
soft

but
he
squeez
it
so
hard
between

and
hi

that
i
wa
forc
to
roar
after
which
they
both
touch
me
with
all

they
were
under
great
perplex
about
my

often

so
orderli

although
it

to

what
it
meant
yet
while
the

were

i

thi

repeat

twice
as
if

meant

the

wherein
i

i

onli

a

shriller

i
began
to

that
thi

belong
to
some

of

among

becaus
there
appear
so
much
ceremoni
befor

that

my

the

so
veri
differ
from
that
of
a

i
wa
oblig
to
my

whereof
they
had
no
concept
the
sorrel
nag
offer
me
a
root
which
he
held
after
their
manner
as
we
shall
describ
in
it
proper
place
between
hi
hoof
and
pastern
i
took
it
in
my

and
have
smelt
it
return
it
to
him
again
as
civilli
as
i
could
he
brought
out
of
the
yahoos_’
kennel
a
piec
of

flesh
but
it
smelt
so
offens
that
i
turn
from

with
loath
he
then
threw
it
to
the

by
whom
it
wa
greedili
devour
he
afterward
show
me
a
wisp
of
hay
and
a
fetlock
full
of
oat
but
i
shook
my
head
to
signifi
that
neither
of
these
were
food
for
me
and
inde
i
now
apprehend
that
i
must
absolut
starv
if
i
did
not
get
to
some
of
my

for

to
those
filthi

although
there
were
few
greater
lover
of

at

than
myself
yet
i
confess
i
never
saw
ani
sensit
be
so
detest
on
all
account
and
the
more
i
came
near
them
the
more
hate
they
grew
while
i
stay
in
that
countri
thi
the
master
hors
observ
by

and
therefor
sent
the

back
to

he
then
put
hi
fore-hoof
to
hi

i
wa
much
surpris
although

did
it
with
eas

with
a

that
appear
perfectli

made
other
sign
to
know
what
i
would
eat
but
i
could
not
return
him
such
an

as
he
wa
abl

if
he

i
did
not

it

i

while

the

when

the

by

thi

i
pronounc
two

three
time
for
although
i
had
refus
them
at
first
yet
upon
second
thought
i
consid
that
i
could
contriv
to
make
of
them
a
kind
of
bread
which
might
be
suffici
with
milk
to
keep
me
aliv
till
i
could
make
my

to
some

and
to
creatur
of

speci
the
hors
immedi
order
a
white

servant
of

to
bring
me
a
good
quantiti
of
oat
in
a
sort
of
wooden
tray
these
i
heat
befor
the
fire
as
well
as
i
could
and
rub
them
till
the
husk
came
off
which
i
made
a
shift
to
winnow
from
the
grain
i
ground
and
beat
them
between
two
stone
then
took
water
and
made
them
into
a
past
or
cake
which
i
toast
at
the
fire
and
eat
warm
with
milk
it
wa
at
first
a
veri
insipid
diet
though
common
enough
in
mani
part
of
europ
but
grew
toler
by
time
and
have
been
often
reduc
to
hard
fare
in
my
life
thi
wa
not
the
first
experi
i
had
made
how
easili
natur
is
satisfi
and
i
cannot
but
observ
that
i
never
had
one
hour’
sick
while
i
stay
in
thi
island
it
is
true
i
sometim
made
a
shift
to
catch
a
rabbit
or
bird
by
spring
made
of
yahoo’
hair
and
i
often
gather
wholesom
herb
which
i
boil
and
ate
as
salad
with
my
bread
and
now
and
then
for
a
rariti
i
made
a
littl
butter
and
drank
the
whey
i
wa
at
first
at
a
great
loss
for
salt
but
custom
soon
reconcil
me
to
the
want
of
it
and
i
am
confid
that
the
frequent
use
of
salt
among
us
is
an
effect
of
luxuri
and
wa
first
introduc
onli
as
a
provoc
to
drink
except
where
it
is
necessari
for
preserv
flesh
in
long
voyag
or
in
place
remot
from
great
market
for
we
observ
no
anim
to
be
fond
of
it
but
man
and
as
to
myself
when
i
left
thi
countri
it
wa
a
great
while
befor
i
could
endur
the
tast
of
it
in
anyth
that
i
ate
thi
is
enough
to
say
upon
the
subject
of
my
diet
wherewith
other
travel
fill
their
book
as
if
the
reader
were
person
concern
whether
we
fare
well
or
ill
howev
it
wa
necessari
to
mention
thi
matter
lest
the
world
should
think
it
imposs
that
i
could
find
susten
for
three
year
in
such

the

observ
when
he
said
“that

the
curios
and
impati
of
my
master
were
so
great
that
he
spent
mani
hour
of
hi
leisur
to
instruct
me
he
wa
convinc
as
he
afterward
told
me
that
i
must
be
a

but
my
teachabl
civil
and
cleanli
astonish
him
which
were
qualiti
altogeth
opposit

anim
he
wa
most
perplex
about
my

reason
sometim
with
himself
whether
they
were
a
part
of
my
bodi
for
i
never
pull
them
off
till
the
famili
were
asleep
and
got
them
on
befor
they
wake
in
the
morn
my
master
wa
eager
to
learn
“whenc
i
came
how
i
acquir
those
appear
of
reason
which
i
discov
in
all
my
action
and
to

my
stori
from

which
he
hope
he
should
soon
do
by
the
great
profici
i
made
in

and
pronounc
their
word
and
sentences.”
to
help
my
memori
i
form
all
i
learn
into
the
english
alphabet
and
writ
the
word
down
with
the
translat
thi
last
after
some
time
i
ventur
to
do
in
my
master’
presenc
it
cost
me
much
troubl
to
explain
to
him
what
i
wa
do
for
the
inhabit
have
not
the
least
idea
of
book
or
literatur
in
about
ten
week
time
i
wa
abl
to
understand
most
of
hi
question
and
in
three
month
could
give
him
some
toler
answer
he
wa
extrem
curiou
to
know
“from
what
part
of
the
countri
i
came
and
how
i
wa
taught
to
imit
a
ration
creatur
becaus
the
yahoo
whom
he
saw
i
exactli
resembl
in
my
head
hand
and
face
that
were
onli
visibl
with
some
appear
of
cun
and
the
strongest
disposit
to
mischief
were
observ
to
be
the
most
unteach
of
all
brutes.”
i
answer
“that
i
came
over
the
sea
from
a
far
place
with
mani
other
of
my
own
kind
in
a
great
hollow
vessel
made
of
the
bodi
of
tree
that
my
companion
forc
me
to
land
on
thi
coast
and
then
left
me
to
shift
for
myself.”
it
wa
with
some
difficulti
and
by
the
help
of
mani
sign
that
i
brought
him
to
understand
me
he
repli
“that
i
must
need
be
mistaken
or
that
i
said
the
thing
which
wa
not;”
for
they
have
no
word
in
their
languag
to
express
lie
or
falsehood
“he
knew
it
wa
imposs
that
there
could
be
a
countri
beyond
the
sea
or
that
a
parcel
of
brute
could
move
a
wooden
vessel
whither
they
pleas
upon
water
he
wa
sure
no
houyhnhnm
aliv
could
make
such
a
vessel
nor
would
trust
yahoo
to
manag
it.”
the
word
houyhnhnm
in
their
tongu
signifi
a
hors
and
in
it
etymolog
the
perfect
of
natur
i
told
my
master
“that
i
wa
at
a
loss
for
express
but
would
improv
as
fast
as
i
could
and
hope
in
a
short
time
i
should
be
abl
to
tell
him
wonders.”
he
wa
pleas
to
direct
hi
own
mare
hi
colt
and
foal
and
the
servant
of
the
famili
to
take
all
opportun
of
instruct
me
and
everi
day
for
two
or
three
hour
he
wa
at
the
same
pain
himself
sever
hors
and
mare
of
qualiti
in
the
neighbourhood
came
often
to
our
hous
upon
the
report
spread
of
“a
wonder
yahoo
that
could
speak
like
a
houyhnhnm
and
seem
in
hi
word
and
action
to
discov
some
glimmer
of
reason.”
these
delight
to
convers
with
me
they
put
mani
question
and
receiv
such
answer
as
i
wa
abl
to
return
by
all
these
advantag
i
made
so
great
a
progress
that
in
five
month
from
my
arriv
i
understood
whatev
wa
spoken
and
could
express
myself
toler
well
the
houyhnhnm
who
came
to
visit
my
master
out
of
a
design
of
see
and
talk
with
me
could
hardli
believ
me
to
be
a
right
yahoo
becaus
my
bodi
had
a
differ
cover
from
other
of
my
kind
they
were
astonish
to
observ
me
without
the
usual
hair
or
skin
except
on
my
head
face
and
hand
but
i
discov
that
secret
to
my
master
upon
an
accid
which
happen
about
a
fortnight
befor
i
have
alreadi
told
the
reader
that
everi
night
when
the
famili
were
gone
to
bed
it
wa
my
custom
to
strip
and
cover
myself
with
my
cloth
it
happen
one
morn
earli
that
my
master
sent
for
me
by
the
sorrel
nag
who
wa
hi
valet
when
he
came
i
wa
fast
asleep
my
cloth
fallen
off
on
one
side
and
my
shirt
abov
my
waist
i
awak
at
the
nois
he
made
and
observ
him
to
deliv
hi
messag
in
some
disord
after
which
he
went
to
my
master
and
in
a
great
fright
gave
him
a
veri
confus
account
of
what
he
had
seen
thi
i
present
discov
for
go
as
soon
as
i
wa
dress
to
pay
my
attend
upon
hi
honour
he
ask
me
“the
mean
of
what
hi
servant
had
report
that
i
wa
not
the
same
thing
when
i
slept
as
i
appear
to
be
at
other
time
that
hi
valet
assur
him
some
part
of
me
wa
white
some
yellow
at
least
not
so
white
and
some
brown.”
i
had
hitherto
conceal
the
secret
of
my
dress
in
order
to
distinguish
myself
as
much
as
possibl
from
that
curs
race
of
yahoo
but
now
i
found
it
in
vain
to
do
so
ani
longer
besid
i
consid
that
my
cloth
and
shoe
would
soon
wear
out
which
alreadi
were
in
a
declin
condit
and
must
be
suppli
by
some
contriv
from
the
hide
of
yahoo
or
other
brute
wherebi
the
whole
secret
would
be
known
i
therefor
told
my
master
“that
in
the
countri
whenc
i
came
those
of
my
kind
alway
cover
their
bodi
with
the
hair
of
certain
anim
prepar
by
art
as
well
for
decenc
as
to
avoid
the
inclem
of
air
both
hot
and
cold
of
which
as
to
my
own
person
i
would
give
him
immedi
convict
if
he
pleas
to
command
me
onli
desir
hi
excus
if
i
did
not
expos
those
part
that
natur
taught
us
to
conceal.”
he
said
“mi
discours
wa
all
veri
strang
but
especi
the
last
part
for
he
could
not
understand
whi
natur
should
teach
us
to
conceal
what
natur
had
given
that
neither
himself
nor
famili
were
asham
of
ani
part
of
their
bodi
but
howev
i
might
do
as
i
pleased.”
whereupon
i
first
unbutton
my
coat
and
pull
it
off
i
did
the
same
with
my
waistcoat
i
drew
off
my
shoe
stock
and
breech
i
let
my
shirt
down
to
my
waist
and
drew
up
the
bottom
fasten
it
like
a

about
my

to
hide

my
master
observ
the
whole

with
great
sign
of
curios
and
admir
he
took
up
all
my
cloth
in
hi
pastern
one
piec
after

and
examin
them
dilig
he
then
stroke
my
bodi
veri
gentli
and
look
round
me
sever
time
after
which
he
said
it
wa
plain
i
must
be
a
perfect

but
that
i
differ
veri
much
from
the
rest
of

he
desir
to

no

and
gave
me
leav
to
put
on
my
cloth
again
for
i
wa
shudder
with

i
express
my
uneasi
at

give
me
so
often
the
appel
of

an

anim
for
which
i
had
so
utter
a

and
contempt
i
beg
he
would
forbear
appli
that
word
to
me
and
make
the

order
in
hi
famili
and
among
hi
friend
whom
he
suffer
to

i
request
likewis
“that

should
last
for
as
to
what
the
sorrel
nag
hi

had
observ
hi

might
command
him
to
conceal
it.”
all
thi
my
master
veri
gracious
consent
to
and
thu
the
secret
wa
kept
till
my
cloth
began
to
wear
out
which
i
wa
forc
to
suppli
by
sever
contriv
that
shall
hereaft
be
mention
in
the
meantim
he
desir
“i
would

ad
“that
he
wait
with
some
impati
to
hear
the
wonder
which
i
promis
to
tell
him.”
from
thenceforward
he
doubl
the
pain
he
had
been
at
to
instruct
me
he
brought
me
into
all
compani
and
made
them
treat
me
with
civil
“because,”
as
he
told
them
privat
“thi
would
put

into

make

more
diverting.”
everi
day
when
i
wait
on
him
besid
the
troubl
he
wa
at
in
teach
he
would
ask
me
sever
question
concern
myself
which
i
answer
as
well
as
i
could
and
by
these
mean
he
had
alreadi
receiv
some
gener
idea
though
veri
imperfect
it
would
be
tediou
to
relat
the
sever
step
by
which
i
advanc
to
a
more
regular
convers
but
the
first
account
i
gave
of
myself
in
ani
order
and
length
wa
to
thi
purpos
“that
i
came
from
a

far
countri
as
i
alreadi
had
attempt
to
tell
him
with
about
fifti
more
of
my

speci
that
we
travel
upon
the

in
a
great
hollow
vessel
made
of
wood
and
larger
than
hi
honour’
hous
i
describ
the
ship
to
him
in
the
best
term
i
could
and
explain
by
the
help
of
my

how
it
wa
driven
forward
by
the
wind
that
upon

among

i
wa

on

i
walk
forward
without

he
ask
me
“who
made
the
ship
and
how
it
wa
possibl
that
the
houyhnhnm
of
my
countri
would
leav
it
to

my
answer
wa
“that
i
durst

would
give

word
and
honour

he
agre
and
i
went
on
by
assur
him
that
the
ship
wa
made
by
creatur
like

who
in
all

i
own
my

but
could
not

for

i
said
farther
“that

my

great
appear

in

the
natur
of

in

have
occas

talk
of

fals
represent
it
wa
with
much
difficulti
that
he
comprehend
what
i
meant
although
he
had
otherwis
a
most
acut
judgment
for
he
argu
thu
“that
the

led
to

black
when

and
these
were
all
the
notion
he
had
concern
that
faculti
of
lie
so
perfectli
well
understood
and
so
univers
practis
among

to

from
thi
digress
when
i
assert
that
the

were
the
onli
govern

in
my

which
my
master
said
wa
altogeth
past
hi
concept
he
desir
to
know
“whether
we
had
houyhnhnm
among
us
and
what
wa
their
employment?”
i
told
him
“we
had
great
number
that
in

they
graze
in

and
in

were
kept
in

“i
understand
you
well,”
said
my

“it
is
now
veri
plain
from
all
you
have
spoken
that
whatev

i
beg
“hi

further
becaus
i
wa

certain
that
the

but
he
insist
in
command
me
to
let
him
know
the
best
and
the
worst
i
told
him
“he
should
be
obeyed.”
i
own
“that
the
houyhnhnm
among
us
whom
we
call
hors
were
the
most
gener
and
come
anim
we
had
that
they
excel
in
strength
and
swift
and
when
they
belong
to
person
of
qualiti
were
employ
in
travel
race
or
draw
chariot
they
were
treat
with
much
kind
and
care
till
they
fell
into
diseas
or
becam
founder
in
the
feet
but
then
they
were
sold
and
use
to
all
kind
of
drudgeri
till
they
die
after
which
their
skin
were
strip
and
sold
for
what
they
were
worth
and
their
bodi
left
to
be
devour
by
dog
and
bird
of
prey
but
the
common
race
of
hors
had
not
so
good
fortun
be
kept
by
farmer
and
carrier
and
other
mean
peopl
who
put
them
to
greater
labour
and
fed
them
worse.”
i
describ
as
well
as
i
could
our
way
of
ride
the
shape
and
use
of
a
bridl
a
saddl
a
spur
and
a
whip
of
har
and
wheel
i
ad
“that
we
fasten
plate
of
a
certain
hard
substanc
call
iron
at
the
bottom
of
their
feet
to
preserv
their
hoof
from
be
broken
by
the
stoni
way
on
which
we
often
travelled.”
my
master
after
some
express
of
great
indign
wonder
“how
we
dare
to
ventur
upon
a
houyhnhnm’
back
for
he
wa
sure
that
the
weakest
servant
in
hi
hous
would
be
abl
to
shake
off
the
strongest
yahoo
or
by
lie
down
and
roll
on
hi
back
squeez
the
brute
to
death.”
i
answer
“that
our
hors
were
train
up
from
three
or
four
year
old
to
the
sever
use
we
intend
them
for
that
if
ani
of
them
prove
intoler
viciou
they
were
employ
for
carriag
that
they
were
sever
beaten
while
they
were
young
for
ani
mischiev
trick
that
the
male
design
for
the
common
use
of
ride
or
draught
were
gener
castrat
about
two
year
after
their
birth
to
take
down
their
spirit
and
make
them
more
tame
and
gentl
that
they
were
inde
sensibl
of
reward
and
punish
but
hi
honour
would
pleas
to
consid
that
they
had
not
the
least
tinctur
of
reason
ani
more
than
the
yahoo
in
thi
country.”
it
put
me
to
the
pain
of
mani
circumlocut
to
give
my
master
a
right
idea
of
what
i
spoke
for
their
languag
doe
not
abound
in
varieti
of
word
becaus
their
want
and
passion
are
fewer
than
among
us
but
it
is
imposs
to
express
hi
nobl
resent
at
our
savag
treatment
of
the
houyhnhnm
race
particularli
after
i
had
explain
the
manner
and
use
of
castrat
hors
among
us
to
hinder
them
from
propag
their
kind
and
to
render
them
more
servil
he
said
“if
it
were
possibl
there
could
be
ani
countri
where
yahoo
alon
were
endu
with
reason
they
certainli
must
be
the
govern
anim
becaus
reason
in
time
will
alway
prevail
against
brutal
strength
but
consid
the
frame
of
our
bodi
and
especi
of
mine
he
thought
no
creatur
of
equal
bulk
wa
so
ill-contriv
for
employ
that
reason
in
the
common
offic
of
life;”
whereupon
he
desir
to
know
“whether
those
among
whom
i
live
resembl
me
or
the
yahoo
of
hi
country?”
i
assur
him
“that
i
wa
as
well
shape
as
most
of
my
age
but
the
younger
and
the
femal
were
much
more
soft
and
tender
and
the
skin
of
the
latter
gener
as
white
as
milk.”
he
said
“i
differ
inde
from
other
yahoo
be
much
more
cleanli
and
not
altogeth
so
deform
but
in
point
of
real
advantag
he
thought
i
differ
for
the
wors
that
my
nail
were
of
no
use
either
to
my
fore
or
hinder
feet
as
to
my
forefeet
he
could
not
properli
call
them
by
that
name
for
he
never
observ
me
to
walk
upon
them
that
they
were
too
soft
to
bear
the
ground
that
i
gener
went
with
them
uncov
neither
wa
the
cover
i
sometim
wore
on

so

behind
that
i
could
not
walk
with
ani
secur
for
if
either
of
my
hinder
feet
slip
i
must
inevit
fall.”
he
then
began
to
find
fault
with
other
part
of
my
bodi
“the
flat
of
my

the
promin
of
my

directli

that

myself
without

of

to

and
therefor
natur
had
place

that
necess
he
knew
not
what
could
be
the
use
of
those
sever

divis
in

behind
that
these
were
too
soft
to

the
hard

made
from
the

of
some

my

which
i
wa
forc

on

off
everi

with

and

lastli
that
he
observ
everi

the

avoid

the

drove
from

so
that
suppos

he

it

which
everi
creatur
discov
against

nor
consequ
how
we
could
tame

howev
he
would,”
as
he
said
“debat
the

no

becaus
he

i
assur
him
“how

i

which
he

i

he
ad
“that

howev
i
would
give

all

i
said
“there
wa
a
societi
of
men
among

bred
up

all

he

to

i
must
then
hire

to

it
be
against

allow

now
in
thi
case
i
who
am

lie
under
two
great
disadvantag
first
my

be
practis
almost
from
hi
cradl
in
defend
falsehood
is
quit
out
of
hi
element
when
he
would
be
an
advoc
for

which
is
an
unnatur
offic
he
alway
attempt
with
great
awkward
if
not
with
ill-wil
the
second
disadvantag
is
that
my
lawyer
must
proceed
with
great
caution
or
els
he
will
be
reprimand
by
the
judg
and
abhor
by
hi
brethren
as
one
that
would
lessen
the
practic
of
the
law
and
therefor
i
have
but
two
method
to
preserv
my
cow
the
first
is
to
gain
over
my
adversary’
lawyer
with
a
doubl
fee
who
will
then
betray
hi
client
by
insinu
that
he
hath
justic
on
hi
side
the
second
way
is
for
my
lawyer
to
make
my
caus
appear
as
unjust
as
he
can
by
allow
the
cow
to
belong
to
my
adversari
and
thi
if
it
be
skil
done
will
certainli
bespeak
the
favour
of
the
bench
now
your
honour
is
to
know
that
these
judg

all

as

as
for

i

to

to

the

the

the

“that

i
enlarg

he
made
me
observ

i

miscarri
they
return
home

for

engag
in
what
i
call
a

among

“that
in

when

they

still
look

great

my
master
said
“he
could
never
discov
the
reason
of
thi
unnatur
appetit
or
how
these
stone
could
be
of
ani
use
to
a
yahoo
but
now
he
believ
it
might
proceed
from
the
same
principl
of
avaric
which
i
had
ascrib
to
mankind
that
he
had
onc
by
way
of
experi
privat
remov
a
heap
of
these
stone
from
the
place
where
one
of
hi

had
buri
it
whereupon
the
sordid
anim
miss
hi
treasur
by
hi
loud
lament
brought
the
whole

to
the
place
there
miser
howl
then
fell
to
bite
and
tear
the
rest
began
to
pine
away
would
neither
eat
nor
sleep
nor
work
till
he
order
a
servant
privat
to
convey
the
stone
into
the

hole
and
hide
them
as
befor
which
when
hi

had
found
he
present
recov
hi
spirit
and
good

but
took
good
care
to
remov
them
to

and
ha
ever

been

my
master
further
assur
me
which
i
also
observ
myself
“that
in
the

where
the

the
fiercest
and
most

he
said
“it
wa
common
when

discov
such

were
contend
which

a

would
take
the
advantag
and
carri
it

which
my
master
would
need
contend
to
have
some
kind
of
resembl
with
our
suit
at

wherein
i
thought
it
for

not

said

that
came
in

whether
herb
root
berri
the
corrupt
flesh
of
anim
or
all
mingl
togeth
and
it
wa
peculiar
in
their
temper
that
they
were
fonder
of
what
they
could
get
by
rapin
or
stealth
at
a

much
better
food
provid

at

if

they
would
eat
till
they
were
readi
to

after

natur
had
point
out
to
them
a
certain
root
that
gave
them
a

“there
wa
also
anoth
kind
of
root

but
somewhat
rare
and
difficult
to
be
found
which
the

sought
for
with
much
eager
and
would
suck
it
with
great
delight
it
produc
in
them
the

effect
that

it
would
make

i
did
inde
observ
that
the

were
the
onli

which
howev
were

fewer

by

neither

a

appel
for

is
borrow

put
down

thi
i
have
sinc
often
known
to
have
been
taken
with
success
and
do
here
freeli
recommend
it

as

against

“a

my
master
confess
“he
could
find
littl
or
no
resembl
between
the
yahoo
of
that
countri
and
those
in
our
for
he
onli
meant
to
observ
what
pariti
there
wa
in

he
had
heard
inde
some
curiou
houyhnhnm
observ
that
in
most
herd
there
wa
a
sort
of
rule
yahoo
as
among
us
there
is
gener
some
lead
or
princip
stag
in
a
park
who
wa
alway
more
deform
in
bodi
and
mischiev
in
disposit
than
ani
of
the
rest
that
thi
leader
had
usual
a
favourit
as
like
himself
as
he
could
get
whose
employ
wa
to
lick
hi
master’
feet
and
posterior
and
drive
the
femal
yahoo
to
hi
kennel
for
which
he
wa
now
and
then
reward
with
a
piec
of
ass’
flesh
thi
favourit
is
hate
by
the
whole
herd
and
therefor
to
protect
himself
keep
alway
near
the
person
of
hi
leader
he
usual
continu
in

till
a
wors
can
be
found
but
the
veri

he
is
discard
hi
successor
at
the
head
of
all
the
yahoo
in
that
district
young
and
old
male
and
femal
come
in
a
bodi
and
discharg
their
excrement
upon
him
from
head
to
foot
but
how
far
thi
might
be
applic
to
our
court
and
favourit
and
minist
of
state
my
master
said
i
could
best
determine.”
i
durst
make
no
return
to
thi
malici
insinu
which
debas
human
understand
below
the
sagac
of
a
common
hound
who
ha
judgment
enough
to
distinguish
and
follow
the
cri
of
the
ablest
dog
in
the
pack
without
be
ever
mistaken
my
master
told
me
“there
were
some
qualiti
remark
in
the
yahoo
which
he
had
not
observ
me
to
mention
or
at
least
veri
slightli
in
the
account
i
had
given
of
humankind.”
he
said
“those
anim
like
other
brute
had
their
femal
in
common
but
in
thi
they
differ
that
the
she
yahoo
would
admit
the
male
while
she
wa
pregnant
and
that
the
he
would
quarrel
and
fight
with
the
femal
as
fierc
as
with
each
other
both
which
practic
were
such
degre
of
infam
brutal
as
no
other
sensit
creatur
ever
arriv
at
“anoth
thing
he
wonder
at
in
the
yahoo
wa
their
strang
disposit
to
nasti
and
dirt
wherea
there
appear
to
be
a
natur
love
of
cleanli
in
all
other
animals.”
as
to
the
two
former
accus
i
wa
glad
to
let
them
pass
without
ani
repli
becaus
i
had
not
a
word
to
offer
upon
them
in
defenc
of
my
speci
which
otherwis
i
certainli
had
done
from
my
own
inclin
but
i
could
have
easili
vindic
humankind
from
the
imput
of
singular
upon
the
last
articl
if
there
had
been
ani
swine
in
that
countri
as
unluckili
for
me
there
were
not
which
although
it
may
be
a
sweeter
quadrup
than
a
yahoo
cannot
i
humbl
conceiv
in
justic
pretend
to
more
cleanli
and
so
hi
honour
himself
must
have
own
if
he
had
seen
their
filthi
way
of
feed
and
their
custom
of
wallow
and
sleep
in
the
mud
my
master
likewis
mention
anoth
qualiti
which
hi
servant
had
discov
in
sever
yahoo
and
to
him
wa
wholli
unaccount
he
said
“a
fanci
would
sometim
take
a
yahoo
to
retir
into
a
corner
to
lie
down
and
howl
and
groan
and
spurn
away
all
that
came
near
him
although
he
were
young
and
fat
want
neither
food
nor
water
nor
did
the
servant
imagin
what
could
possibl
ail
him
and
the
onli
remedi
they
found
wa
to
set
him
to
hard
work
after
which
he
would
infal
come
to
himself.”
to
thi
i
wa
silent
out
of
partial
to
my
own
kind
yet
here
i
could
plainli
discov
the
true
seed
of
spleen
which
onli
seiz
on
the
lazi
the
luxuri
and
the
rich
who
if
they
were
forc
to
undergo
the
same
regimen
i
would
undertak
for
the
cure
hi
honour
had
further
observ
“that
a
femal
yahoo
would
often
stand
behind
a
bank
or
a
bush
to
gaze
on
the
young
male
pass
by
and
then
appear
and
hide
use
mani
antic
gestur
and
grimac
at
which
time
it
wa
observ
that
she
had
a
most
offens
smell
and
when
ani
of
the
male
advanc
would
slowli
retir
look
often
back
and
with
a
counterfeit
show
of
fear
run
off
into
some
conveni
place
where
she
knew
the
male
would
follow
her
“at
other
time
if
a
femal
stranger
came
among
them
three
or
four
of
her
own
sex
would
get
about
her
and
stare
and
chatter
and
grin
and
smell
her
all
over
and
then
turn
off
with
gestur
that
seem
to
express
contempt
and
disdain.”
perhap
my
master
might
refin
a
littl
in
these
specul
which
he
had
drawn
from
what
he
observ
himself
or
had
been
told
him
by
other
howev
i
could
not
reflect
without
some
amaz
and
much
sorrow
that
the
rudiment
of
lewd
coquetri
censur
and
scandal
should
have
place
by
instinct
in

i
expect
everi

that
my

would
accus
the

of
those
unnatur

so
common

i

it

that
i

bring
my

could

taught

in

when
i
use
to

our

i
wa
infinit
delight
with

in

where
noth
pass

what
wa
use
express

as

thi
i
found
to
be

for

those

which
veri
much
enliven

often
upon

i
may
add
without
vaniti
that
my
presenc
often
gave
them
suffici
matter
for

becaus
it
afford
my

an
occas
of
let
hi

into
the
histori
of
me
and
my
countri
upon
which
they
were
all
pleas
to
descant
in
a
manner
not
veri
advantag
to
humankind
and
for
that
reason
i
shall
not
repeat
what
they
said
onli
i
may
be
allow
to
observ
that
hi
honour
to
my
great
admir
appear
to
understand
the
natur
of
yahoo
much
better
than
myself
he
went
through
all
our
vice
and
folli
and
discov
mani
which
i
had
never
mention
to
him
by
onli
suppos
what
qualiti
a
yahoo
of
their
countri
with
a
small
proport
of
reason
might
be
capabl
of
exert
and
conclud
with
too
much
probabl
“how
vile
as
well
as
miser
such
a
creatur
must
be.”
i
freeli
confess
that
all
the
littl
knowledg
i
have
of
ani
valu
wa
acquir
by
the
lectur
i
receiv
from
my
master
and
from
hear
the
discours
of
him
and
hi
friend
to
which
i
should
be
prouder
to
listen
than
to
dictat
to
the
greatest
and
wisest
assembl
in
europ
i
admir
the
strength
comeli
and
speed
of
the
inhabit
and
such
a
constel
of
virtu
in
such
amiabl
person
produc
in
me
the
highest
vener
at
first
inde
i
did
not
feel
that
natur
awe
which
the
yahoo
and
all
other
anim
bear
toward
them
but
it
grew
upon
me
by
degre
much
sooner
than
i
imagin
and
wa
mingl
with
a
respect
love
and
gratitud
that
they
would
condescend
to
distinguish
me
from
the
rest
of
my
speci
when
i
thought
of
my
famili
my
friend
my
countrymen
or
the
human
race
in
gener
i
consid
them
as
they
realli
were
yahoo
in
shape
and
disposit
perhap
a
littl
more
civil
and
qualifi
with
the
gift
of
speech
but
make
no
other
use
of
reason
than
to
improv
and
multipli
those
vice
whereof
their
brethren
in
thi
countri
had
onli
the
share
that
natur
allot
them
when
i
happen
to
behold
the
reflect
of
my
own
form
in
a
lake
or
fountain
i
turn
away
my
face
in
horror
and
detest
of
myself
and
could
better
endur
the
sight
of
a
common
yahoo
than
of
my
own
person
by
convers
with
the
houyhnhnm
and
look
upon
them
with
delight
i
fell
to
imit
their
gait
and
gestur
which
is
now
grown
into
a
habit
and
my
friend
often
tell
me
in
a
blunt
way
“that
i
trot
like
a
horse;”
which
howev
i
take
for
a
great
compliment
neither
shall
i
disown
that
in
speak
i
am
apt
to
fall
into
the
voic
and
manner
of
the
houyhnhnm
and
hear
myself
ridicul
on
that
account
without
the
least
mortif
in
the
midst
of
all
thi
happi
and
when
i
look
upon
myself
to
be
fulli
settl
for
life
my
master
sent
for
me
one
morn
a
littl
earlier
than
hi
usual
hour
i
observ
by
hi
counten
that
he
wa
in
some
perplex
and
at
a
loss
how
to
begin
what
he
had
to
speak
after
a
short
silenc
he
told
me
“he
did
not
know
how
i
would
take
what
he
wa
go
to
say
that
in
the
last
gener
assembl
when
the
affair
of
the
yahoo
wa
enter
upon
the
repres
had
taken
offenc
at
hi
keep
a
yahoo
mean
myself
in
hi
famili
more
like
a
houyhnhnm
than
a
brute
anim
that
he
wa
known
frequent
to
convers
with
me
as
if
he
could
receiv
some
advantag
or
pleasur
in
my
compani
that
such
a
practic
wa
not
agreeabl
to
reason
or
natur
or
a
thing
ever
heard
of
befor
among
them
the
assembl
did
therefor
exhort
him
either
to
employ
me
like
the
rest
of
my
speci
or
command
me
to
swim
back
to
the
place
whenc
i
came
that
the
first
of
these
expedi
wa
utterli
reject
by
all
the
houyhnhnm
who
had
ever
seen
me
at
hi
hous
or
their
own
for
they
alleg
that
becaus
i
had
some
rudiment
of
reason
ad
to
the
natur
praviti
of
those
anim
it
wa
to
be
fear
i
might
be
abl
to
seduc
them
into
the
woodi
and
mountain
part
of
the
countri
and
bring
them
in
troop
by
night
to
destroy
the
houyhnhnms’
cattl
as
be
natur
of
the
raven
kind
and
avers
from
labour.”
my
master
ad
“that
he
wa
daili
press
by
the
houyhnhnm
of
the
neighbourhood
to
have
the
assembly’
exhort
execut
which
he
could
not
put
off
much
longer
he
doubt
it
would
be
imposs
for
me
to
swim
to
anoth
countri
and
therefor
wish
i
would
contriv
some
sort
of
vehicl
resembl
those
i
had
describ
to
him
that
might
carri
me
on
the
sea
in
which
work
i
should
have
the
assist
of
hi
own
servant
as
well
as
those
of
hi
neighbours.”
he
conclud
“that
for
hi
own
part
he
could
have
been
content
to
keep
me
in
hi
servic
as
long
as
i
live
becaus
he
found
i
had
cure
myself
of
some
bad
habit
and
disposit
by
endeavour
as
far
as
my
inferior
natur
wa
capabl
to
imit
the
houyhnhnms_.”
i
should
here
observ
to
the
reader
that
a
decre
of
the
gener
assembl
in
thi
countri
is
express
by
the
word
hnhloayn
which
signifi
an
exhort
as
near
as
i
can
render
it
for
they
have
no
concept
how
a
ration
creatur
can
be
compel
but
onli
advis
or
exhort
becaus
no
person
can
disobey
reason
without
give
up
hi
claim
to
be
a
ration
creatur
i
wa
struck
with
the
utmost
grief
and
despair
at
my
master’
discours
and
be
unabl
to
support
the
agoni
i
wa
under
i
fell
into
a
swoon
at
hi
feet
when
i
came
to
myself
he
told
me
“that
he
conclud
i
had
been
dead;”
for
these
peopl
are
subject
to
no
such
imbecil
of
natur
i
answer
in
a
faint
voic
“that
death
would
have
been
too
great
a
happi
that
although
i
could
not
blame
the
assembly’
exhort
or
the
urgenc
of
hi
friend
yet
in
my
weak
and
corrupt
judgment
i
thought
it
might
consist
with
reason
to
have
been
less
rigor
that
i
could
not
swim
a

probabl
the
nearest

to

that
mani

off
were
wholli
want
in
thi
countri
which
howev
i
would
attempt
in
obedi
and
gratitud
to
hi
honour
although
i
conclud
the
thing
to
be
imposs
and
therefor
look
on
myself
as
alreadi
devot
to
destruct
that
the
certain
prospect
of
an
unnatur

wa
the
least
of
my
evil
for
suppos
i
should
escap
with
life
by
some
strang
adventur
how
could
i
think
with
temper
of
pass
my
day
among
yahoo
and
relaps
into
my
old
corrupt
for
want
of
exampl
to
lead
and
keep
me
within
the
path
of
virtue?
that
i
knew
too
well
upon
what
solid
reason
all
the
determin
of
the
wise
houyhnhnm
were
found
not
to
be
shaken
by
argument
of
mine
a
miser
yahoo
and
therefor
after
present
him
with
my
humbl
thank
for
the
offer
of
hi
servants’
assist
in
make
a
vessel
and
desir
a

for
so
difficult
a

i
told
him
i
would
endeavour
to
preserv
a

if
ever
i
return
to

wa
not
without
hope
of
be

my
master
in
a
few
word
made
me
a
veri
graciou
repli
allow
me
the
space
of
two
month
to
finish
my

order
the
sorrel

my
fellow-serv
for
so
at
thi
distanc
i
may
presum
to
call
him
to
follow
my
instruct
becaus
i
told
my
master
“that
hi
help
would
be
suffici
and
i
knew
he
had
a
tender
for
me.”
in
hi
compani
my

where
my

had
order

to
be
set

i
got
upon
a
height
and
look
on

i
saw
a

took
out

could
then
clearli
distinguish

abov
five
leagu
off

i
comput

it
appear
to
the

to
be
onli
a
blue
cloud
for
as
he
had
no

howev
i

of

consid
i
should

and
that
the

might
chop
about
i

to
set
up
my

and
thu
with
the

of

i
went
at
the

of
a

and
a
half
an
hour
as
near
as
i
could
guess
my
master
and
hi

continu
on

till
i
wa
almost
out
of

and
i
often
heard
the

nag
who
alway
love
me
cri
out
“_hnuy

“take

my

wa
if
possibl
to
discov
some
small
island
uninhabit
yet
suffici
by
my
labour
to
furnish
me
with
the
necessari
of
life
which
i
would
have
thought
a
greater
happi
than
to
be
first
minist
in
the
politest
court
of
europ
so
horribl
wa
the
idea
i
conceiv
of
return
to
live
in
the
societi
and
under
the
govern
of
yahoo
for
in
such
a
solitud
as
i
desir
i
could
at
least
enjoy
my
own
thought
and
reflect
with
delight
on
the
virtu
of
those
inimit
houyhnhnm
without
an
opportun
of
degener
into
the
vice
and
corrupt
of
my
own
speci
the
reader
may
rememb
what
i
relat
when
my
crew
conspir
against
me
and
confin
me
to
my
cabin
how
i
continu
there
sever
week
without
know
what
cours
we
took
and
when
i
wa
put
ashor
in
the
long-boat
how
the
sailor
told
me
with
oath
whether
true
or
fals
“that
they
knew
not
in
what
part
of
the
world
we
were.”
howev
i
did
then
believ
us
to
be
about
10
degre
southward
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
or
about
45
degre
southern
latitud
as
i
gather
from
some
gener
word
i
overheard
among
them
be
i
suppos
to
the
south-east
in
their
intend
voyag
to
madagascar
and
although
thi
were
littl
better
than
conjectur
yet
i
resolv
to
steer
my
cours
eastward
hope
to
reach
the
south-west
coast
of
new
holland
and
perhap
some
such
island
as
i
desir
lie
westward
of
it
the
wind
wa
full
west
and
by
six
in
the
even
i
comput
i
had
gone
eastward
at

eighteen
leagu
when
i
spi
a
veri
small

about
half
a

off

i
soon
reach

wa
noth

a

with

arch
by
the
forc
of

here
i
put
in

and
climb
a

i
could
plainli
discov
land
to
the
east
extend
from
south
to

i
lay
all
night
in
my

and
repeat
my
voyag
earli
in
the
morn
i
arriv
in
seven
hour
to
the
south-east
point
of

thi
confirm
me
in

opinion
i
have
long
entertain
that
the

place
thi

at

three

thought
i

year

to
my
worthi
friend
mr
herman
moll
and
gave
him
my
reason
for
it
although
he
ha
rather
chosen
to
follow
other

i
saw
no
inhabit
in
the
place
where
i
land
and
be
unarm
i
wa
afraid
of
ventur
far
into
the
countri
i
found
some
shellfish
on

shore
and
ate

raw
not
dare
to
kindl
a

for
fear
of
be
discov
by

i
continu
three

feed
on

found
a

of

which
gave
me
great
relief
on
the
fourth
day
ventur
out
earli
a
littl
too

i
saw
twenti
or

not

five
hundr

they
were
stark
nake
men

advanc

at

i
made

shove
off
the

retreat
ran
after

and
befor
i
could
get
far
enough
into

discharg
an
arrow
which
wound
me
deepli
on
the
insid
of
my

knee
i
shall
carri
the
mark
to

i
apprehend
the
arrow
might
be
poison
and
paddl
out
of
the
reach
of
their

be
a
calm
day
i
made
a
shift
to
suck
the
wound
and
dress
it
as
well
as
i
could
i
wa
at
a
loss
what
to
do
for
i
durst
not
return
to
the

landing-plac
but
stood
to
the
north
and
wa
forc
to
paddl
for
the

though
veri
gentl
wa
against
me
blow
north-west
as
i
wa
look
about
for
a
secur
landing-plac
i
saw
a
sail
to
the
north-north-east
which
appear
everi
minut
more
visibl
i
wa
in
some
doubt
whether
i
should
wait
for
them
or
not

at

my
detest
of
the
yahoo
race
prevail
and
turn
my
cano
i
sail
and
paddl
togeth
to
the
south
and
got
into
the

creek
whenc
i
set
out
in
the
morn
choos
rather
to
trust
myself
among
these
barbarian
than
live
with
european
yahoo
i
drew
up
my
cano
as
close
as
i
could
to
the
shore
and
hid
myself
behind
a
stone
by
the
littl
brook
which
as
i
have
alreadi
said
wa
excel
water
the
ship
came
within
half
a
leagu
of
thi
creek
and
sent
her
long-boat
with
vessel
to
take
in
fresh
water
for
the
place
it
seem
wa
veri
well
known
but
i
did
not
observ
it
till
the
boat
wa
almost
on
shore
and
it
wa
too
late
to
seek
anoth
hiding-plac
the
seamen
at
their
land
observ
my
cano
and
rummag
it
all
over
easili
conjectur
that
the
owner
could
not
be
far
off
four
of
them
well
arm
search
everi
cranni
and
lurking-hol
till
at
last
they
found
me
flat
on
my
face
behind
the
stone
they
gaze
awhil
in
admir
at
my
strang
uncouth
dress
my
coat
made
of
skin
my
wooden-sol
shoe
and
my
fur
stock
whenc
howev
they
conclud
i
wa
not
a
nativ
of
the
place
who
all
go
nake
one
of
the
seamen
in
portugues
bid
me
rise
and
ask
who
i
wa
i
understood
that
languag
veri
well
and
get
upon
my
feet
said
“i
wa
a
poor
yahoo
banish
from
the
houyhnhnm
and
desir
they
would
pleas
to
let
me
depart.”
they
admir
to
hear
me
answer
them
in
their
own
tongu
and
saw
by
my
complexion
i
must
be
a
european
but
were
at
a
loss
to
know
what
i
meant
by
yahoo
and
houyhnhnm
and
at
the
same
time
fell
a-laugh
at
my
strang
tone
in
speak
which
resembl
the
neigh
of
a
hors
i
trembl
all
the
while
betwixt
fear
and
hatr
i
again
desir
leav
to
depart
and
wa
gentli
move
to
my
cano
but
they
laid
hold
of
me
desir
to
know
“what
countri
i
wa
of?
whenc
i
came?”
with
mani
other
question
i
told
them
“i
wa
born
in
england
whenc
i
came
about
five
year
ago
and
then
their
countri
and
our
were
at
peac
i
therefor
hope
they
would
not
treat
me
as
an
enemi
sinc
i
meant
them
no
harm
but
wa
a
poor
yahoo
seek
some
desol
place
where
to
pass
the
remaind
of
hi
unfortun
life.”
when
they
began
to
talk
i
thought
i
never
heard
or
saw
ani
thing
more
unnatur
for
it
appear
to
me
as
monstrou
as
if
a
dog
or
a
cow
should
speak
in
england
or
a
yahoo
in
houyhnhnmland
the
honest
portugues
were
equal
amaz
at
my
strang
dress
and
the
odd
manner
of
deliv
my
word
which
howev
they
understood
veri
well
they
spoke
to
me
with
great
human
and
said
“they
were
sure
the
captain
would
carri
me
grati
to
lisbon
whenc
i
might
return
to
my
own
countri
that
two
of
the
seamen
would
go
back
to
the
ship
inform
the
captain
of
what
they
had
seen
and
receiv
hi
order
in
the
mean
time
unless
i
would
give
my
solemn
oath
not
to

they
would
secur
me
by

i
thought
it
best
to
compli
with
their
propos
they
were
veri
curiou
to
know
my
stori
but
i
gave
them
veri
littl
satisfact
and
they
all
conjectur
that
my
misfortun
had
impair
my
reason
in
two
hour
the
boat
which
went
laden
with
vessel
of
water
return
with
the
captain’
command
to
fetch
me
on
board
i
fell
on
my
knee
to
preserv
my
liberti
but
all
wa
in
vain
and
the
men
have
tie
me
with
cord
heav
me
into
the
boat
whenc
i
wa
taken
into
the
ship
and
thenc
into
the
captain’
cabin
hi
name
wa
pedro
de

he
wa
a

courteou
and
gener
person
he
entreat
me
to
give
some
account
of
myself
and
desir
to
know
what
i
would
eat
or
drink
said
“i
should
be
use
as
well
as

and
spoke
so
mani
oblig
thing
that
i
wonder
to
find
such
civil
from
a
yahoo
howev
i
remain
silent
and
sullen
i
wa
readi
to
faint
at
the
veri
smell
of
him
and
hi
men
at
last
i
desir
someth
to
eat
out
of
my
own
cano
but
he
order
me
a
chicken
and
some
excel
wine
and
then
direct
that
i
should
be
put
to
bed
in
a
veri
clean
cabin
i
would
not
undress
myself
but
lay
on
the
bed-cloth
and
in
half
an
hour
stole
out
when
i
thought
the
crew
wa
at
dinner
and
get
to
the
side
of
the
ship
wa
go
to
leap
into
the
sea
and
swim
for
my
life
rather
than
continu
among
yahoo
but
one
of
the
seamen
prevent
me
and
have
inform
the
captain
i
wa
chain
to
my
cabin
after
dinner
don
pedro
came
to
me
and
desir
to
know
my
reason
for
so
desper
an
attempt
assur
me
“he
onli
meant
to
do
me
all
the
servic
he
wa
able;”
and
spoke
so
veri
movingli
that
at
last
i
descend
to
treat
him
like
an
anim
which
had
some
littl
portion
of
reason
i
gave
him
a
veri
short
relat
of
my
voyag
of
the
conspiraci
against
me
by
my
own
men
of
the
countri
where
they
set
me
on
shore
and
of
my
five
year
resid
there
all
which
he
look
upon
as
if
it
were
a
dream
or
a
vision
whereat
i
took
great
offenc
for
i
had
quit
forgot
the
faculti
of
lie
so
peculiar
to
yahoo
in
all
countri
where
they
presid
and
consequ
their
disposit
of
suspect
truth
in
other
of
their
own
speci
i
ask
him
“whether
it
were
the
custom
in
hi
countri
to
say
the
thing
which
wa
not?”
i
assur
him
“i
had
almost
forgot
what
he
meant
by
falsehood
and
if
i
had
live
a
thousand
year
in
houyhnhnmland
i
should
never
have
heard
a
lie
from
the
meanest
servant
that
i
wa
altogeth
indiffer
whether
he
believ
me
or
not
but
howev
in
return
for
hi
favour
i
would
give
so
much
allow
to
the
corrupt
of
hi
natur
as
to
answer
ani
object
he
would
pleas
to
make
and
then
he
might
easili
discov
the
truth.”
the
captain
a
wise
man
after
mani
endeavour
to
catch
me
trip
in
some
part
of
my
stori
at
last
began
to
have
a
better
opinion
of
my
verac
but
he
ad
“that
sinc
i
profess
so
inviol
an
attach
to
truth
i
must
give
him
my
word
and
honour
to
bear
him
compani
in
thi
voyag
without
attempt
ani
thing
against
my
life
or
els
he
would
continu
me
a
prison
till
we
arriv
at
lisbon.”
i
gave
him
the
promis
he
requir
but
at
the
same
time
protest
“that
i
would
suffer
the
greatest
hardship
rather
than
return
to
live
among
yahoos_.”
our
voyag
pass
without
ani
consider
accid
in
gratitud
to
the
captain
i
sometim
sat
with
him
at
hi
earnest
request
and
strove
to
conceal
my
antipathi
against
humankind
although
it
often
broke
out
which
he
suffer
to
pass
without
observ
but
the
greatest
part
of
the
day
i
confin
myself
to
my
cabin
to
avoid

had
often

to

at

earnest
request
he
led
me
up
to

backward
i
conjur
him
“to

fright
in
a
week’
time
he
seduc
me
down
to
the
door
i
found
my
terror
gradual
lessen
but
my
hatr
and
contempt
seem
to
increas
i
wa
at
last
bold
enough
to
walk
the
street
in
hi
compani
but
kept
my
nose
well
stop
with
rue
or
sometim
with
tobacco
in
ten
day
don
pedro
to
whom
i
had
given
some
account
of
my
domest
affair
put
it
upon
me
as
a
matter
of
honour
and
conscienc
“that
i
ought
to
return
to
my
nativ
countri
and
live
at
home
with
my
wife
and
children.”
he
told
me
“there
wa
an
english
ship
in
the
port
just
readi
to
sail
and
he
would
furnish
me
with
all
thing
necessary.”
it
would
be
tediou
to
repeat
hi
argument
and
my
contradict
he
said
“it
wa
altogeth
imposs
to
find
such
a
solitari
island
as
i
desir
to
live
in
but
i
might
command
in
my
own
hous
and
pass
my
time
in
a
manner
as
reclus
as
i
pleased.”
i
compli
at
last
find
i
could
not
do
better
i
left
lisbon
the
24th
day
of
novemb
in
an

never
inquir

accompani
me
to

and
lent
me
twenti

he
took
kind
leav
of

embrac
me
at

have
not

i
have

avoid

are
often

justli

i
meddl
not

with

whatsoev
i

for
the
noblest
end

over

i
may
without

pretend
to

i

never

may
look

or
possibl
give
the

offenc
even
to
those
who
are
most
readi
to
take
it
so
that
i

i
may
with

i
doubt
whether

be
as
easi
as

are
hardli
worth

i
question
whether
it
might
be
prudent
